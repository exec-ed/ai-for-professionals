|------|------|-------------|
| **Part 1: Map** | 10 min | Document your current workflow |
| **Part 2: Redesign** | 15 min | Identify where AI adds value and redesign |
| **Part 3: Test** | 10 min | Try one AI-assisted step live |
| **Part 4: Share** | 5 min | 2-minute lightning presentation to your table |

## Part 1: Map Your Current Workflow (10 min)

### Choose your task

Pick a task you do at least weekly that takes 30+ minutes. It should be something you find repetitive or time-consuming.

**My task:**

>

**How often do I do this?**

> Weekly / Fortnightly / Monthly / Other: ____________

**How long does it typically take?**

> ____________ minutes

---

### Document the current steps

Write each step of how you do this task today. Be specific — include the tools you use and what you do at each step.

| Step | What I Do | Tool/System | Time (min) |
|------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | | | |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |
| 4 | | | |
| 5 | | | |
| 6 | | | |
| 7 | | | |
| 8 | | | |

**Total current time:** ____________ minutes

### Identify the pain points

What makes this task tedious, slow, or frustrating?

- [ ] Lots of manual data entry or copying between systems
- [ ] Repetitive writing or formatting
- [ ] Gathering information from multiple sources
- [ ] Summarising or synthesising large amounts of content
- [ ] Doing the same analysis each time with different data
- [ ] Creating the same type of document over and over
- [ ] Other: ____________________________________________

## Part 2: Redesign with AI (15 min)

### Classify each step

Go back to your steps above. For each one, use the **AI Opportunity Finder** to classify it:

| Step | Current Task | AI Opportunity Type | AI Could... |
|------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1 | | Automate / Assist / Generate / Analyse / Human-Only | |
| 2 | | Automate / Assist / Generate / Analyse / Human-Only | |
| 3 | | Automate / Assist / Generate / Analyse / Human-Only | |
| 4 | | Automate / Assist / Generate / Analyse / Human-Only | |
| 5 | | Automate / Assist / Generate / Analyse / Human-Only | |
| 6 | | Automate / Assist / Generate / Analyse / Human-Only | |
| 7 | | Automate / Assist / Generate / Analyse / Human-Only | |
| 8 | | Automate / Assist / Generate / Analyse / Human-Only | |

**Quick reference — AI Opportunity Types:**
- **Automate:** Routine, pattern-based, no judgment needed
- **Assist:** Research, synthesis, gathering — AI does legwork, you evaluate
- **Generate:** Writing, drafting, content creation — AI drafts, you edit
- **Analyse:** Data, patterns, trends — AI crunches, you interpret
- **Human-Only:** Empathy, ethics, judgment, relationships — keep this yours

### Design the new workflow

Rewrite your workflow with AI integrated at each applicable step. For AI-assisted steps, note what tool you'd use and what prompt you'd write.

| Step | What Happens | Who Does It | Tool | Estimated Time |
|------|-------------|-------------|------|----------------|
| 1 | | Me / AI / Both | | |
| 2 | | Me / AI / Both | | |
| 3 | | Me / AI / Both | | |
| 4 | | Me / AI / Both | | |
| 5 | | Me / AI / Both | | |
| 6 | | Me / AI / Both | | |
| 7 | | Me / AI / Both | | |
| 8 | | Me / AI / Both | | |

**Estimated new total time:** ____________ minutes

**Time saved:** ____________ minutes (____________%)

---

### Check your redesign

Before moving on, sanity-check your new workflow:

- [ ] Is there still a human review step before anything goes out?
- [ ] Am I keeping Human-Only tasks for myself?
- [ ] Does any step involve putting confidential data into a free AI tool? (If so, reconsider.)
- [ ] Is the time estimate realistic, or am I being optimistic?
- [ ] Would this workflow still work if the AI gives a bad output? (What's my fallback?)

## Part 3: Test One Step Live (10 min)

Pick the single most promising AI-assisted step from your redesign. Try it right now.

**Step I'm testing:**

>

**The prompt I used (apply RTCF):**

| Component | My Input |
|-----------|----------|
| **Role** | |
| **Task** | |
| **Context** | |
| **Format** | |

**What happened:**

>

**Quality of output (circle one):** Usable as-is / Needs minor editing / Needs heavy editing / Not usable

**What I'd change next time:**

>

## Part 4: Lightning Presentation (5 min)

Prepare a 2-minute summary for your table. Cover:

1. **My task:** What it is and how long it takes now
2. **The biggest AI opportunity:** Which step benefits most from AI
3. **My redesign:** What the new workflow looks like
4. **What I tested:** What happened when I tried it live
5. **What I'll try first on Monday:** My next step

## Before / After Summary

| | Before | After |
|---|--------|-------|
| **Total time** | | |
| **Steps requiring my full attention** | | |
| **Steps AI handles or assists with** | | |
| **Biggest improvement** | | |
| **Biggest risk to manage** | | |
