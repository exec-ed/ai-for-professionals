## Framework 1: AI Task Suitability Spectrum

**Purpose:** Decide whether a task is suitable for AI assistance — and what kind of assistance

**The question it answers:** *"Should I use AI for this, and how much should I rely on it?"*

---

### The Four Zones

| Zone | AI Role | Your Role | Best For |
|------|---------|-----------|----------|
| **AI-Led** | Does the heavy lifting | Review and approve | Routine, pattern-based work |
| **AI-Assisted** | Provides substantial help | Guide and verify | Tasks needing judgment + speed |
| **Human-Led, AI-Supported** | Handles sub-tasks | Lead the overall work | Complex work with routine parts |
| **Human-Only** | Not involved | Full ownership | Empathy, ethics, novel judgment |

---

### Zone 1: AI-Led

AI does most of the work. You review, approve, and send.

**Characteristics of these tasks:**
- Routine and repetitive
- Clear patterns and formats
- Low risk if output is imperfect
- High volume

**Examples:**
- Formatting raw notes into meeting minutes
- Converting bullet points into a polished email
- Translating a document between languages
- Generating a first draft of a standard report
- Summarising a long article to key points

**Your role:** Provide clear instructions, review output for errors, make final edits.

---

### Zone 2: AI-Assisted

AI provides substantial help, but you're actively shaping the work throughout.

**Characteristics of these tasks:**
- Require some professional judgment
- Benefit from speed or breadth AI provides
- Medium risk — errors would be noticed
- Iterative process (multiple rounds of refinement)

**Examples:**
- Drafting a client proposal (AI drafts, you refine with client knowledge)
- Analysing survey results (AI finds patterns, you interpret meaning)
- Researching a topic (AI gathers information, you evaluate relevance)
- Writing a job description (AI drafts structure, you add role-specific nuance)
- Preparing presentation slides (AI generates outline and content, you adjust for audience)

**Your role:** Set direction, review critically, add expertise the AI can't have, iterate.

---

### Zone 3: Human-Led, AI-Supported

You lead the work. AI handles specific sub-tasks within it.

**Characteristics of these tasks:**
- Complex overall, but contain routine components
- Require strategic thinking or creative direction
- High stakes — quality matters significantly
- AI can accelerate specific parts

**Examples:**
- Strategy document (you set direction; AI helps with research, formatting, competitor data)
- Performance review (you assess the person; AI helps structure the feedback document)
- Project planning (you make decisions; AI helps generate risk lists, timeline drafts, checklists)
- Negotiation preparation (you plan the approach; AI helps summarise past interactions, draft talking points)
- Budget proposal (you set priorities; AI helps model scenarios, format tables)

**Your role:** Own the thinking and decisions. Delegate well-defined sub-tasks to AI.

---

### Zone 4: Human-Only

AI should not be involved. These tasks require qualities AI does not have.

**Characteristics of these tasks:**
- Require genuine empathy or emotional intelligence
- Involve ethical judgment with real consequences
- Need deep personal or organisational context
- Demand accountability that can't be delegated

**Examples:**
- Having a difficult conversation with an employee
- Making a decision that affects someone's career
- Navigating a sensitive political situation
- Responding to a personal crisis in your team
- Setting the creative vision for a project
- Making ethical trade-offs with no clear right answer

**Your role:** Full ownership. Your judgment, your empathy, your accountability.

---

### Quick Decision Guide

Ask yourself these questions about any task:

```
1. Is this routine and pattern-based?
   YES → Consider AI-Led
   NO  → Continue...

2. Does it need my professional judgment throughout?
   YES → Consider AI-Assisted
   NO  → Continue...

3. Is it complex overall, but has routine sub-parts?
   YES → Consider Human-Led, AI-Supported
   NO  → Continue...

4. Does it require empathy, ethics, or accountability?
   YES → Human-Only
```

**When in doubt, start with more human involvement and delegate to AI as you build trust.**

---

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

## Framework 2: RTCF Prompt Framework

**Purpose:** Write effective prompts that get useful AI output on the first or second try

**The question it answers:** *"How do I ask AI for what I actually need?"*

---

### The Four Components

Every effective prompt contains some combination of these four elements:

### R — Role

Tell the AI who it should be.

**Why it matters:** Setting a role activates relevant patterns in the AI's training. A "financial analyst" writes differently than a "marketing copywriter."

**Examples:**
- "You are an experienced project manager..."
- "Act as a data analyst who specialises in retail..."
- "You are a professional editor reviewing a business document..."
- "Respond as a customer service trainer..."

**Tip:** Be specific. "You are a senior HR consultant with 15 years of experience in Australian employment law" is far more useful than "You are an HR expert."

---

### T — Task

Tell the AI exactly what to do.

**Why it matters:** Vague tasks produce vague results. Specific tasks produce specific results.

**Bad:**
- "Help me with this report"
- "Write something about our project"
- "Analyse this data"

**Good:**
- "Summarise this report into 5 bullet points for a board presentation"
- "Write a 200-word project status update covering progress, risks, and next steps"
- "Identify the top 3 trends in this dataset and explain why each matters"

**Tip:** Include the verb (summarise, draft, analyse, compare, explain, list, rewrite) and the scope (how many, how long, what to cover).

---

### C — Context

Give the AI the background it needs.

**Why it matters:** AI doesn't know your company, your audience, your history, or your constraints. Without context, it gives generic output.

**Types of context to provide:**
- **Audience:** "This is for senior executives who are not technical"
- **Background:** "We're a mid-sized retail company with 500 employees"
- **Constraints:** "Keep it under 300 words" or "Use Australian English"
- **Situation:** "We just lost a major client and need to reassure the team"
- **Prior work:** Paste in relevant documents, notes, or data

**Tip:** More context almost always produces better results. When in doubt, include it.

---

### F — Format

Tell the AI how to structure the output.

**Why it matters:** Without format instructions, AI defaults to generic paragraphs. Specifying format gives you output you can actually use.

**Format options:**
- "Use bullet points"
- "Present as a numbered list"
- "Create a table with columns for [X], [Y], [Z]"
- "Write in short paragraphs, no more than 3 sentences each"
- "Use headers and sub-headers"
- "Format as an email with subject line"
- "Structure as: Problem, Analysis, Recommendation"

**Tip:** If you want output you can paste directly into a document, specify the exact format of that document.

---

### Putting It All Together

**Basic prompt (no framework):**
> "Write me an email about the project delay"

**RTCF prompt:**
> **Role:** You are a project manager who communicates clearly and professionally.
>
> **Task:** Write an email to the client explaining that our project delivery will be delayed by 2 weeks.
>
> **Context:** The delay is due to a vendor dependency — their API integration took longer than expected. The client is generally understanding but values transparency. We have a good relationship. The new delivery date is March 15.
>
> **Format:** Keep the email under 200 words. Use a professional but warm tone. Structure as: acknowledge the delay, explain the reason briefly, confirm the new date, reaffirm our commitment.

**The difference:** The first prompt produces a generic email you'll need to heavily rewrite. The second produces something close to what you'd actually send.

---

### RTCF Quick Reference Card

| Component | Question to Ask Yourself | Example |
|-----------|-------------------------|---------|
| **Role** | Who should the AI be? | "You are a senior financial analyst" |
| **Task** | What exactly should it do? | "Create a variance analysis comparing Q1 to Q2" |
| **Context** | What does the AI need to know? | "This is for a CFO who wants a 2-minute verbal summary" |
| **Format** | How should the output look? | "Table with 3 columns: Category, Variance, Explanation" |

**Not every prompt needs all four.** A simple task might only need T and F. A complex task benefits from all four. Use your judgment.

---

### Common Prompt Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Too vague**
- "Help me with this" → AI has nothing to work with
- Fix: Add a specific task verb and scope

**Mistake 2: No context**
- "Write a marketing email" → Generic, unusable output
- Fix: Add audience, product, tone, purpose

**Mistake 3: No format specification**
- "Analyse this data" → Wall of text you can't use
- Fix: Specify bullet points, tables, word counts, structure

**Mistake 4: Too much at once**
- "Write a full business case with executive summary, market analysis, financial projections, risk assessment, and implementation plan" → Shallow on everything
- Fix: Break into separate prompts, one section at a time

**Mistake 5: Not iterating**
- Accepting the first output as final
- Fix: Treat the first response as a draft. Say "Make it more concise" or "Add more detail on X" or "Change the tone to be more formal"

---

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

## Framework 3: AI-Assisted Analysis Workflow

**Purpose:** A systematic process for using AI to analyse data and produce trustworthy insights

**The question it answers:** *"How do I use AI to make sense of my data without getting fooled by wrong answers?"*

---

### The Six Steps

```
PREPARE  →  UPLOAD  →  QUESTION  →  VERIFY  →  REFINE  →  PRESENT
   1           2          3           4          5          6
```

---

### Step 1: Prepare

**Before you touch any AI tool, clarify what you want to know.**

| Do This | Not This |
|---------|----------|
| "What are the top drivers of customer complaints in Q4?" | "Analyse this spreadsheet" |
| "Is there a relationship between team size and project delays?" | "Look at this data and tell me something interesting" |
| "Which product categories are growing fastest month-over-month?" | "What does this data mean?" |

**Why it matters:** If you don't know what question you're answering, you can't evaluate whether the AI's answer is good.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] What is the specific question I need answered?
- [ ] Who is the audience for the findings?
- [ ] What decisions will this analysis inform?
- [ ] What would a useful answer look like?

---

### Step 2: Upload

**Get your data into the AI tool.**

**Methods:**
- **Copy/paste:** Works for small datasets (<100 rows). Paste directly into the chat.
- **File upload:** Most AI tools accept CSV, Excel, and PDF files. Use this for larger datasets.
- **Describe it:** If you can't share the data, describe its structure. "I have a spreadsheet with 500 rows. Columns are: Date, Product, Region, Sales, Returns."

**Before uploading, check:**
- [ ] Does this data contain personal or confidential information? (If yes, do NOT upload to free-tier AI tools)
- [ ] Is the data clean enough? (Remove obvious errors, fill blank headers)
- [ ] Are column names clear? (Rename cryptic headers before uploading)

**Tip:** Clean column names and consistent formatting make a bigger difference than you'd expect. "Q4_Revenue_AUD" is much better than "col_7".

---

### Step 3: Question

**Ask progressively deeper questions.**

Start broad, then narrow down:

| Round | Type | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| 1 | **Overview** | "Summarise this dataset. What are the key columns, how many rows, and what time period does it cover?" |
| 2 | **Descriptive** | "What are the averages, minimums, and maximums for the Sales column? Break down by Region." |
| 3 | **Patterns** | "Are there any trends over time? Which months show unusual spikes or drops?" |
| 4 | **Drivers** | "What factors seem most associated with high return rates?" |
| 5 | **Recommendations** | "Based on this analysis, what are the top 3 actions you'd recommend to reduce returns?" |

**Tip:** Each question builds on the previous answer. If something in the AI's response surprises you, follow up: "You mentioned Region C has the highest returns — break that down by product category."

---

### Step 4: Verify

**Cross-check the AI's findings against what you know.**

**Verification checklist:**
- [ ] Do the numbers match what I'd expect? (Spot-check totals, averages)
- [ ] Does this align with what I already know about the business?
- [ ] Are there obvious errors? (e.g., percentages that don't add to 100, impossible values)
- [ ] Did the AI interpret my question correctly?
- [ ] If it created a chart, do the axes and labels make sense?

**Common AI analysis errors:**
- Miscounting rows (especially with filtered data)
- Confusing correlation with causation
- Ignoring missing data instead of flagging it
- Producing mathematically impossible results (e.g., growth rates that don't match the underlying numbers)
- Inventing data points that aren't in the source

**The rule:** If a finding would change a decision, verify it manually before acting on it.

---

### Step 5: Refine

**Iterate based on what you've learned.**

Common refinement prompts:
- "Break this down further by [category]"
- "Exclude [outliers/time period] and re-run the analysis"
- "Focus only on [specific segment] — what patterns emerge?"
- "The return rate you calculated seems high — double-check your methodology"
- "Create a chart showing [specific comparison]"

**Tip:** The best analyses come from 3-5 rounds of questioning and refinement, not from a single prompt.

---

### Step 6: Present

**Have AI help format findings for your audience.**

**Prompt template for presentation-ready output:**

> Based on our analysis, create a summary for [audience]. Include:
> - Key finding 1 with supporting data
> - Key finding 2 with supporting data
> - Key finding 3 with supporting data
> - Recommended actions
>
> Format as [bullet points / one-page brief / executive summary / presentation slides].
> Use [plain language / technical detail] appropriate for [audience].

**Remember:** The AI's analysis is your starting point. Add your professional interpretation, business context, and judgment before presenting.

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

## Framework 4: AI Opportunity Finder

**Purpose:** Identify where AI can add value in your daily work

**The question it answers:** *"Which parts of my job should I start using AI for?"*

---

### The Four Opportunity Types

### 1. Automate — High-Volume, Repetitive Tasks

**The signal:** You do it frequently, it follows the same pattern, and it doesn't require judgment.

**Examples:**
| Task | AI Automation |
|------|--------------|
| Formatting weekly reports | AI generates from raw data in consistent format |
| Sorting and categorising emails | AI labels and routes based on content |
| Scheduling follow-ups | AI suggests times and drafts reminders |
| Data entry from forms | AI extracts and enters structured data |
| Status update compilation | AI aggregates updates from multiple sources |

**Where to start:** Pick the task you do most frequently that bores you the most. That's your first automation candidate.

---

### 2. Assist — Information Synthesis and Research

**The signal:** You spend time reading, gathering, comparing, or summarising information from multiple sources.

**Examples:**
| Task | AI Assistance |
|------|--------------|
| Researching a topic before a meeting | AI summarises key articles and perspectives |
| Reviewing long documents | AI extracts key points and flags important sections |
| Comparing vendor proposals | AI creates side-by-side comparison tables |
| Preparing meeting briefings | AI synthesises relevant background from multiple sources |
| Staying current on industry trends | AI summarises recent developments |

**Where to start:** Pick the research or reading task that takes you the longest. Try giving AI the source material and asking for a summary.

---

### 3. Generate — Content Drafting and Creation

**The signal:** You create written content regularly — emails, reports, proposals, presentations, documentation.

**Examples:**
| Task | AI Generation |
|------|--------------|
| Client emails | AI drafts based on context, you edit and send |
| Meeting agendas | AI generates from objectives and attendee list |
| Process documentation | AI drafts from your verbal explanation |
| Presentation outlines | AI creates structure from your key points |
| Job postings | AI drafts from role requirements |

**Where to start:** Pick the document you write most often. Give AI a good example of one you've written before and ask it to draft the next one.

---

### 4. Analyse — Data Review and Pattern Detection

**The signal:** You work with data, spreadsheets, or reports and need to find meaning in them.

**Examples:**
| Task | AI Analysis |
|------|------------|
| Monthly performance reviews | AI identifies trends and anomalies in KPI data |
| Customer feedback analysis | AI categorises themes and sentiment |
| Budget variance analysis | AI highlights significant deviations and possible causes |
| Survey results interpretation | AI groups responses and identifies patterns |
| Competitive benchmarking | AI compares metrics across competitors |

**Where to start:** Pick a dataset or report you review regularly. Upload it to an AI tool and ask "What are the 3 most important things I should know from this data?"

---

### Finding Your Opportunities: The Weekly Audit

Spend 10 minutes mapping your typical week:

**Step 1: List your recurring tasks**

Write down everything you do in a typical week that takes more than 15 minutes.

**Step 2: Categorise each task**

| Task | Category | Current Time | AI Potential |
|------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| *Example: Write weekly status report* | Generate | 45 min | High — AI can draft from my notes |
| *Example: Review team expense claims* | Analyse | 30 min | Medium — AI can flag outliers |
| *Example: Coach underperforming team member* | Human-Only | 60 min | None — requires empathy |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Step 3: Pick your first three**

Choose the three tasks with the highest AI potential and the most time saved. Start with those.

---

### The Priority Matrix

Use this to decide what to tackle first:

```
                    HIGH time saved
                         |
         Quick Wins      |     Big Wins
       (do these first)  |   (plan for these)
                         |
  LOW effort ————————————+———————————————— HIGH effort
                         |
       Low Priority      |     Worth It Later
     (skip for now)      |   (revisit in a month)
                         |
                    LOW time saved
```

**Quick Wins (low effort, high time saved):** Start here. These build confidence and momentum.
**Big Wins (high effort, high time saved):** Plan for these. They often require workflow redesign.
**Worth It Later:** Revisit after you've built AI fluency from the quick wins.
**Low Priority:** Don't bother unless something changes.

---

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

## How the Four Frameworks Work Together

The frameworks build on each other in a natural sequence:

```
Step 1: SHOULD I use AI for this?
        → AI Task Suitability Spectrum

Step 2: HOW do I ask AI effectively?
        → RTCF Prompt Framework

Step 3: How do I use AI with DATA specifically?
        → AI-Assisted Analysis Workflow

Step 4: WHERE else in my work can AI help?
        → AI Opportunity Finder
```

**In practice:**

1. **Encounter a task** at work
2. **Check the Spectrum** — is this AI-Led, AI-Assisted, Human-Led, or Human-Only?
3. **If AI is involved**, write a prompt using **RTCF**
4. **If the task involves data**, follow the **Analysis Workflow**
5. **Once a week**, use the **Opportunity Finder** to spot new tasks to try with AI

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Starting with the hardest task**
- What happens: You pick your most complex task, get disappointing results, and give up
- Fix: Start with a Quick Win. Build skills on easy tasks before tackling complex ones

**Mistake 2: Using AI without verifying**
- What happens: You send AI-generated content with errors, damaging your credibility
- Fix: Always review. The 2 minutes you spend checking saves the hours spent fixing mistakes

**Mistake 3: Vague prompts, then blaming the tool**
- What happens: "Write me a report" produces generic output, so you conclude AI is useless
- Fix: Use RTCF. Invest 60 seconds in a good prompt, save 60 minutes in revision

**Mistake 4: Trying to automate Human-Only tasks**
- What happens: Using AI for tasks requiring empathy or ethical judgment produces tone-deaf results
- Fix: Check the Suitability Spectrum first. Some tasks are yours alone

**Mistake 5: Not iterating**
- What happens: Accepting the first output as final, even when it's not quite right
- Fix: Treat AI output as a first draft. Follow up: "Make it shorter," "Add more detail on X," "Change the tone"

**Mistake 6: Forgetting about privacy**
- What happens: Pasting confidential data into a free AI tool
- Fix: Check your company's AI policy. When in doubt, don't upload sensitive data

---
