        <h3 id="zone-1-ai-led">Zone 1: AI-Led</h3>
        <p>AI does most of the work. You review, approve, and send.</p>
        <p><strong>Characteristics of these tasks:</strong> - Routine
        and repetitive - Clear patterns and formats - Low risk if output
        is imperfect - High volume</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong> - Formatting raw notes into
        meeting minutes - Converting bullet points into a polished email
        - Translating a document between languages - Generating a first
        draft of a standard report - Summarising a long article to key
        points</p>
        <p><strong>Your role:</strong> Provide clear instructions,
        review output for errors, make final edits.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3 id="zone-2-ai-assisted">Zone 2: AI-Assisted</h3>
        <p>AI provides substantial help, but you’re actively shaping the
        work throughout.</p>
        <p><strong>Characteristics of these tasks:</strong> - Require
        some professional judgment - Benefit from speed or breadth AI
        provides - Medium risk — errors would be noticed - Iterative
        process (multiple rounds of refinement)</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong> - Drafting a client proposal (AI
        drafts, you refine with client knowledge) - Analysing survey
        results (AI finds patterns, you interpret meaning) - Researching
        a topic (AI gathers information, you evaluate relevance) -
        Writing a job description (AI drafts structure, you add
        role-specific nuance) - Preparing presentation slides (AI
        generates outline and content, you adjust for audience)</p>
        <p><strong>Your role:</strong> Set direction, review critically,
        add expertise the AI can’t have, iterate.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3 id="zone-3-human-led-ai-supported">Zone 3: Human-Led,
        AI-Supported</h3>
        <p>You lead the work. AI handles specific sub-tasks within
        it.</p>
        <p><strong>Characteristics of these tasks:</strong> - Complex
        overall, but contain routine components - Require strategic
        thinking or creative direction - High stakes — quality matters
        significantly - AI can accelerate specific parts</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong> - Strategy document (you set
        direction; AI helps with research, formatting, competitor data)
        - Performance review (you assess the person; AI helps structure
        the feedback document) - Project planning (you make decisions;
        AI helps generate risk lists, timeline drafts, checklists) -
        Negotiation preparation (you plan the approach; AI helps
        summarise past interactions, draft talking points) - Budget
        proposal (you set priorities; AI helps model scenarios, format
        tables)</p>
        <p><strong>Your role:</strong> Own the thinking and decisions.
        Delegate well-defined sub-tasks to AI.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3 id="zone-4-human-only">Zone 4: Human-Only</h3>
        <p>AI should not be involved. These tasks require qualities AI
        does not have.</p>
        <p><strong>Characteristics of these tasks:</strong> - Require
        genuine empathy or emotional intelligence - Involve ethical
        judgment with real consequences - Need deep personal or
        organisational context - Demand accountability that can’t be
        delegated</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong> - Having a difficult conversation
        with an employee - Making a decision that affects someone’s
        career - Navigating a sensitive political situation - Responding
        to a personal crisis in your team - Setting the creative vision
        for a project - Making ethical trade-offs with no clear right
        answer</p>
        <p><strong>Your role:</strong> Full ownership. Your judgment,
        your empathy, your accountability.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3 id="quick-decision-guide">Quick Decision Guide</h3>
        <p>Ask yourself these questions about any task:</p>
        <pre><code>1. Is this routine and pattern-based?
   YES → Consider AI-Led
   NO  → Continue...

2. Does it need my professional judgment throughout?
   YES → Consider AI-Assisted
   NO  → Continue...

3. Is it complex overall, but has routine sub-parts?
   YES → Consider Human-Led, AI-Supported
   NO  → Continue...

4. Does it require empathy, ethics, or accountability?
   YES → Human-Only</code></pre>
        <p><strong>When in doubt, start with more human involvement and
        delegate to AI as you build trust.</strong></p>

        <div style="page-break-before: always;">

        </div>
        <h2 id="framework-2-rtcf-prompt-framework">Framework 2: RTCF
        Prompt Framework</h2>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Write effective prompts that get
        useful AI output on the first or second try</p>
        <p><strong>The question it answers:</strong> <em>“How do I ask
        AI for what I actually need?”</em></p>
        <hr />
        <h3 id="the-four-components">The Four Components</h3>
        <p>Every effective prompt contains some combination of these
        four elements:</p>
        <h3 id="r-role">R — Role</h3>
        <p>Tell the AI who it should be.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Setting a role activates
        relevant patterns in the AI’s training. A “financial analyst”
        writes differently than a “marketing copywriter.”</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong> - “You are an experienced project
        manager…” - “Act as a data analyst who specialises in retail…” -
        “You are a professional editor reviewing a business document…” -
        “Respond as a customer service trainer…”</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Be specific. “You are a senior HR
        consultant with 15 years of experience in Australian employment
        law” is far more useful than “You are an HR expert.”</p>
        <hr />
        <h3 id="t-task">T — Task</h3>
        <p>Tell the AI exactly what to do.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Vague tasks produce vague
        results. Specific tasks produce specific results.</p>
        <p><strong>Bad:</strong> - “Help me with this report” - “Write
        something about our project” - “Analyse this data”</p>
        <p><strong>Good:</strong> - “Summarise this report into 5 bullet
        points for a board presentation” - “Write a 200-word project
        status update covering progress, risks, and next steps” -
        “Identify the top 3 trends in this dataset and explain why each
        matters”</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Include the verb (summarise, draft,
        analyse, compare, explain, list, rewrite) and the scope (how
        many, how long, what to cover).</p>
        <hr />
        <h3 id="c-context">C — Context</h3>
        <p>Give the AI the background it needs.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> AI doesn’t know your
        company, your audience, your history, or your constraints.
        Without context, it gives generic output.</p>
        <p><strong>Types of context to provide:</strong> -
        <strong>Audience:</strong> “This is for senior executives who
        are not technical” - <strong>Background:</strong> “We’re a
        mid-sized retail company with 500 employees” -
        <strong>Constraints:</strong> “Keep it under 300 words” or “Use
        Australian English” - <strong>Situation:</strong> “We just lost
        a major client and need to reassure the team” - <strong>Prior
        work:</strong> Paste in relevant documents, notes, or data</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> More context almost always produces
        better results. When in doubt, include it.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3 id="f-format">F — Format</h3>
        <p>Tell the AI how to structure the output.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Without format instructions,
        AI defaults to generic paragraphs. Specifying format gives you
        output you can actually use.</p>
        <p><strong>Format options:</strong> - “Use bullet points” -
        “Present as a numbered list” - “Create a table with columns for
        [X], [Y], [Z]” - “Write in short paragraphs, no more than 3
        sentences each” - “Use headers and sub-headers” - “Format as an
        email with subject line” - “Structure as: Problem, Analysis,
        Recommendation”</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you want output you can paste
        directly into a document, specify the exact format of that
        document.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting It All Together</h3>
        <p><strong>Basic prompt (no framework):</strong> &gt; “Write me
        an email about the project delay”</p>
        <p><strong>RTCF prompt:</strong> &gt; <strong>Role:</strong> You
        are a project manager who communicates clearly and
        professionally. &gt; &gt; <strong>Task:</strong> Write an email
        to the client explaining that our project delivery will be
        delayed by 2 weeks. &gt; &gt; <strong>Context:</strong> The
        delay is due to a vendor dependency — their API integration took
        longer than expected. The client is generally understanding but
        values transparency. We have a good relationship. The new
        delivery date is March 15. &gt; &gt; <strong>Format:</strong>
        Keep the email under 200 words. Use a professional but warm
        tone. Structure as: acknowledge the delay, explain the reason
        briefly, confirm the new date, reaffirm our commitment.</p>
        <p><strong>The difference:</strong> The first prompt produces a
        generic email you’ll need to heavily rewrite. The second
        produces something close to what you’d actually send.</p>

        <hr />
        <h3 id="common-prompt-mistakes">Common Prompt Mistakes</h3>
        <p><strong>Mistake 1: Too vague</strong> - “Help me with this” →
        AI has nothing to work with - Fix: Add a specific task verb and
        scope</p>
        <p><strong>Mistake 2: No context</strong> - “Write a marketing
        email” → Generic, unusable output - Fix: Add audience, product,
        tone, purpose</p>
        <p><strong>Mistake 3: No format specification</strong> -
        “Analyse this data” → Wall of text you can’t use - Fix: Specify
        bullet points, tables, word counts, structure</p>
        <p><strong>Mistake 4: Too much at once</strong> - “Write a full
        business case with executive summary, market analysis, financial
        projections, risk assessment, and implementation plan” → Shallow
        on everything - Fix: Break into separate prompts, one section at
        a time</p>
        <p><strong>Mistake 5: Not iterating</strong> - Accepting the
        first output as final - Fix: Treat the first response as a
        draft. Say “Make it more concise” or “Add more detail on X” or
        “Change the tone to be more formal”</p>

        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> If you don’t know what
        question you’re answering, you can’t evaluate whether the AI’s
        answer is good.</p>
        <p><strong>Checklist:</strong> - [ ] What is the specific
        question I need answered? - [ ] Who is the audience for the
        findings? - [ ] What decisions will this analysis inform? - [ ]
        What would a useful answer look like?</p>

        <h3 id="step-2-upload">Step 2: Upload</h3>
        <p><strong>Get your data into the AI tool.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Methods:</strong> - <strong>Copy/paste:</strong>
        Works for small datasets (&lt;100 rows). Paste directly into the
        chat. - <strong>File upload:</strong> Most AI tools accept CSV,
        Excel, and PDF files. Use this for larger datasets. -
        <strong>Describe it:</strong> If you can’t share the data,
        describe its structure. “I have a spreadsheet with 500 rows.
        Columns are: Date, Product, Region, Sales, Returns.”</p>
        <p><strong>Before uploading, check:</strong> - [ ] Does this
        data contain personal or confidential information? (If yes, do
        NOT upload to free-tier AI tools) - [ ] Is the data clean
        enough? (Remove obvious errors, fill blank headers) - [ ] Are
        column names clear? (Rename cryptic headers before
        uploading)</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Clean column names and consistent
        formatting make a bigger difference than you’d expect.
        “Q4_Revenue_AUD” is much better than “col_7”.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3 id="step-3-question">Step 3: Question</h3>
        <p><strong>Ask progressively deeper questions.</strong></p>
        <p>Start broad, then narrow down:</p>
        <table>
        <colgroup>

        rows, and what time period does it cover?”</td>

        <td>3</td>
        <td><strong>Patterns</strong></td>
        <td>“Are there any trends over time? Which months show unusual
        spikes or drops?”</td>

        <td>4</td>

        recommend to reduce returns?”</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Each question builds on the previous
        answer. If something in the AI’s response surprises you, follow
        up: “You mentioned Region C has the highest returns — break that
        down by product category.”</p>
        <hr />
        <h3 id="step-4-verify">Step 4: Verify</h3>
        <p><strong>Cross-check the AI’s findings against what you
        know.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Verification checklist:</strong> - [ ] Do the numbers
        match what I’d expect? (Spot-check totals, averages) - [ ] Does
        this align with what I already know about the business? - [ ]
        Are there obvious errors? (e.g., percentages that don’t add to
        100, impossible values) - [ ] Did the AI interpret my question
        correctly? - [ ] If it created a chart, do the axes and labels
        make sense?</p>
        <p><strong>Common AI analysis errors:</strong> - Miscounting
        rows (especially with filtered data) - Confusing correlation
        with causation - Ignoring missing data instead of flagging it -
        Producing mathematically impossible results (e.g., growth rates
        that don’t match the underlying numbers) - Inventing data points
        that aren’t in the source</p>
        <p><strong>The rule:</strong> If a finding would change a
        decision, verify it manually before acting on it.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3 id="step-5-refine">Step 5: Refine</h3>
        <p><strong>Iterate based on what you’ve learned.</strong></p>
        <p>Common refinement prompts: - “Break this down further by
        [category]” - “Exclude [outliers/time period] and re-run the
        analysis” - “Focus only on [specific segment] — what patterns
        emerge?” - “The return rate you calculated seems high —
        double-check your methodology” - “Create a chart showing
        [specific comparison]”</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> The best analyses come from 3-5 rounds
        of questioning and refinement, not from a single prompt.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3 id="step-6-present">Step 6: Present</h3>
        <p><strong>Have AI help format findings for your
        audience.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Prompt template for presentation-ready
        output:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Based on our analysis, create a summary for [audience].
        Include: - Key finding 1 with supporting data - Key finding 2
        with supporting data - Key finding 3 with supporting data -
        Recommended actions</p>
        <p>Format as [bullet points / one-page brief / executive summary
        / presentation slides]. Use [plain language / technical detail]
        appropriate for [audience].</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Remember:</strong> The AI’s analysis is your starting
        point. Add your professional interpretation, business context,
        and judgment before presenting.</p>

        <h2 id="common-mistakes-to-avoid">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
        <p><strong>Mistake 1: Starting with the hardest task</strong> -
        What happens: You pick your most complex task, get disappointing
        results, and give up - Fix: Start with a Quick Win. Build skills
        on easy tasks before tackling complex ones</p>
        <p><strong>Mistake 2: Using AI without verifying</strong> - What
        happens: You send AI-generated content with errors, damaging
        your credibility - Fix: Always review. The 2 minutes you spend
        checking saves the hours spent fixing mistakes</p>
        <p><strong>Mistake 3: Vague prompts, then blaming the
        tool</strong> - What happens: “Write me a report” produces
        generic output, so you conclude AI is useless - Fix: Use RTCF.
        Invest 60 seconds in a good prompt, save 60 minutes in
        revision</p>
        <p><strong>Mistake 4: Trying to automate Human-Only
        tasks</strong> - What happens: Using AI for tasks requiring
        empathy or ethical judgment produces tone-deaf results - Fix:
        Check the Suitability Spectrum first. Some tasks are yours
        alone</p>
        <p><strong>Mistake 5: Not iterating</strong> - What happens:
        Accepting the first output as final, even when it’s not quite
        right - Fix: Treat AI output as a first draft. Follow up: “Make
        it shorter,” “Add more detail on X,” “Change the tone”</p>
        <p><strong>Mistake 6: Forgetting about privacy</strong> - What
        happens: Pasting confidential data into a free AI tool - Fix:
        Check your company’s AI policy. When in doubt, don’t upload
        sensitive data</p>

        Across All Frameworks</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>AI is a tool, not a colleague</strong> — you own the
        output and the decisions</li>
        <li><strong>Better input = better output</strong> — invest in
        your prompts</li>
        <li><strong>Verify before you trust</strong> — especially facts,
        numbers, and reasoning</li>
        <li><strong>Start small, build confidence</strong> — quick wins
        before big workflows</li>
        <li><strong>Iterate, don’t accept</strong> — first drafts are
        starting points</li>
