        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
        <p>AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are now freely
        available to anyone with a browser. They can draft emails,
        summarise documents, analyse data, write code, and brainstorm
        ideas — but they also hallucinate facts, miss nuance, and
        confidently deliver nonsense. This pre-reading gives you the
        conceptual foundation you need before the workshop: how these
        tools actually work (pattern-matching, not thinking), what
        they’re reliably good at, where they fall apart, and how to stay
        safe with company data. The goal isn’t to make you an expert —
        it’s to get you comfortable enough that the workshop can focus
        on building real skills, not explaining basics.</p>
        <p><strong>Reading time:</strong> 20 minutes <strong>Key
        takeaway:</strong> AI tools are powerful pattern-matching
        assistants, not intelligent colleagues — the better you
        understand what’s actually happening, the better results you’ll
        get.</p>

        <h2 id="who-this-is-for">Who This Is For</h2>
        <p>This is not a reading for executives making investment
        decisions or project managers leading AI initiatives. This is
        for <strong>you</strong> — a professional who wants to use AI
        tools effectively in your daily work.</p>
        <p>You might be: - A marketing coordinator who’s heard ChatGPT
        can draft copy - A finance analyst wondering if AI can help with
        spreadsheets - An HR manager curious about using AI for policy
        documents - An operations lead who wants to automate repetitive
        reporting - A professional in any field who feels like everyone
        else “gets” AI and you’re behind</p>
        <p><strong>You’re not behind.</strong> Most people are still
        figuring this out. That’s what the workshop is for.</p>

        <p>These are all built on the same underlying technology:
        <strong>large language models (LLMs)</strong>.</p>
        <h3 id="how-they-actually-work">How They Actually Work</h3>
        <p>Here’s the most important thing to understand about AI
        tools:</p>
        <p><strong>They predict the next word.</strong></p>
        <p>That’s it. When you type “Write me an email to a client
        about…”, the AI doesn’t <em>understand</em> your request the way
        a colleague would. It predicts what words are most likely to
        come next, based on patterns it learned from billions of pages
        of text during training.</p>
        <p>Think of it as <strong>autocomplete on steroids:</strong> -
        Your phone’s autocomplete predicts one word at a time - AI tools
        predict thousands of words at a time - The result often
        <em>looks</em> like understanding — but it’s
        pattern-matching</p>
        <p><strong>Why this matters to you:</strong> - AI is incredibly
        good at tasks where patterns exist (writing styles, document
        formats, data structures) - AI is unreliable at tasks requiring
        genuine understanding (novel reasoning, factual accuracy,
        nuanced judgment) - Your job is to know the difference</p>
        <h3 id="the-confident-nonsense-problem">The “Confident Nonsense”
        Problem</h3>
        <p>AI tools have a distinctive failure mode: <strong>they never
        say “I don’t know.”</strong></p>
        <p>Ask a colleague a question they can’t answer, and they’ll say
        “I’m not sure, let me check.” Ask an AI the same question, and
        it will give you a confident, well-structured, completely wrong
        answer.</p>
        <p>This is called <strong>hallucination</strong> — the AI
        generates plausible-sounding content that is factually
        incorrect.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples of hallucination:</strong> - Citing academic
        papers that don’t exist - Inventing statistics with specific
        numbers - Making up features of real products - Creating fake
        but realistic-looking legal precedents</p>
        <p><strong>The rule:</strong> AI output needs human
        verification. Always. Especially for facts, numbers, quotes, and
        references.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2 id="part-2-what-ai-tools-are-good-at">Part 2: What AI Tools
        Are Good At</h2>
        <h3 id="reliable-strengths">Reliable Strengths</h3>
        <p>These are tasks where AI tools consistently perform well:</p>
        <p><strong>1. Drafting and Writing</strong> - First drafts of
        emails, reports, proposals - Rewriting text for different
        audiences (formal → casual, technical → plain language) -
        Expanding bullet points into paragraphs - Condensing long
        documents into summaries</p>
        <p><strong>Why it works well:</strong> Writing follows patterns
        (grammar, structure, tone) that AI has seen billions of examples
        of.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Summarising and Extracting</strong> - Condensing a
        20-page report to key points - Pulling specific information from
        long documents - Creating meeting summaries from notes -
        Extracting data from unstructured text</p>
        <p><strong>Why it works well:</strong> The information is
        already there — AI just needs to identify what’s important based
        on your instructions.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Brainstorming and Ideation</strong> - Generating
        options you haven’t considered - Exploring a problem from
        different angles - Creating lists of possibilities - Playing
        devil’s advocate on your ideas</p>
        <p><strong>Why it works well:</strong> AI has seen enormous
        variety in how people approach problems, so it can suggest
        angles you might not think of.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Formatting and Transforming</strong> - Converting
        data between formats (CSV to table, list to paragraph) -
        Restructuring documents - Creating consistent formatting across
        materials - Generating templates from examples</p>
        <p><strong>Why it works well:</strong> Format conversion is pure
        pattern-matching — exactly what AI excels at.</p>
        <p><strong>5. Explaining and Teaching</strong> - Breaking down
        complex concepts into simple language - Explaining technical
        topics to non-technical audiences - Creating step-by-step
        instructions - Answering “how does X work?” questions</p>
        <p><strong>Why it works well:</strong> The AI has seen thousands
        of explanations of most topics and can adapt the level to your
        needs.</p>
        <p><strong>6. Data Analysis (with the right approach)</strong> -
        Finding patterns in spreadsheets - Creating charts and
        visualisations - Running basic statistical analysis - Answering
        questions about datasets</p>
        <p><strong>Why it works well:</strong> Data analysis follows
        well-defined procedures that AI can execute — but results need
        human interpretation.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2 id="part-3-where-ai-tools-fall-apart">Part 3: Where AI Tools
        Fall Apart</h2>
        <h3 id="known-weaknesses">Known Weaknesses</h3>
        <p>These are tasks where AI tools regularly fail or produce
        unreliable results:</p>
        <p><strong>1. Factual Accuracy</strong> - AI does not “know”
        facts the way you do - It generates text that <em>sounds</em>
        factual based on patterns - Specific numbers, dates, names, and
        citations are frequently wrong - Recent events may be unknown
        (training data has a cutoff date)</p>
        <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Always verify facts, especially
        numbers and references. Use AI for structure and drafting, not
        as a source of truth.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Maths and Precise Calculations</strong> - AI makes
        arithmetic errors regularly - Complex calculations are
        unreliable - It may round, estimate, or hallucinate numbers -
        Spreadsheet formulas it writes may contain errors</p>
        <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Use AI to write formulas or set up
        analysis, then verify the results. Don’t trust AI-generated
        numbers without checking.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Logical Reasoning</strong> - Multi-step logic
        problems trip AI up - It can miss obvious contradictions -
        Complex “if-then” chains become unreliable - It may agree with
        you even when you’re wrong</p>
        <p><strong>The fix:</strong> For complex reasoning, break the
        problem into small steps and verify each one. Don’t rely on AI
        for critical logical deductions.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Understanding Your Specific Context</strong> - AI
        doesn’t know your company, your team, your industry norms - It
        gives generic advice unless you provide specific context - It
        can’t read the room or understand office politics - It doesn’t
        know what happened in yesterday’s meeting</p>
        <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Provide context explicitly. The
        more specific information you give, the more relevant the
        output. This is what prompt engineering is about — and it’s the
        core of the workshop.</p>
        <p><strong>5. Consistency Across Long Conversations</strong> -
        AI can contradict itself in long conversations - It may “forget”
        instructions from earlier in the chat - Style and tone can drift
        over time - Complex multi-part tasks may lose coherence</p>
        <p><strong>The fix:</strong> For important work, start fresh
        conversations. Restate key requirements. Don’t assume the AI
        “remembers” what you discussed 20 messages ago.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2 id="part-4-the-ai-landscape-beyond-chatbots">Part 4: The AI
        Landscape Beyond Chatbots</h2>
        <h3 id="ai-is-bigger-than-chat">AI Is Bigger Than Chat</h3>
        <p>Chatbots are the most visible AI tools, but AI is
        increasingly embedded in software you already use:</p>
        <p><strong>AI in Productivity Software:</strong> - Microsoft
        Copilot in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook - Google Workspace
        AI in Docs, Sheets, Gmail - Notion AI for notes and
        documentation - Canva AI for design</p>
        <p><strong>AI in Specialist Tools:</strong> - Grammarly (writing
        quality) - Otter.ai (meeting transcription) - Beautiful.ai
        (presentation design) - Tableau AI (data visualisation)</p>
        <p><strong>AI in Automation Platforms:</strong> - Zapier
        (connecting apps with AI steps) - Make (workflow automation) -
        Power Automate (Microsoft ecosystem automation)</p>
        <p><strong>The trend:</strong> AI is moving from “a separate
        tool you go to” to “a capability built into every tool you
        already use.” Within a few years, using AI won’t feel like a
        separate activity — it’ll just be how software works.</p>
        <h3 id="types-of-ai-assistance">Types of AI Assistance</h3>

        <h3 id="what-happens-to-your-data">What Happens to Your
        Data?</h3>
        <p>When you type something into an AI tool, you should
        assume:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Free tiers:</strong> Your input may be used to train
        future models. Don’t enter sensitive data.</li>
        <li><strong>Paid tiers:</strong> Most providers (OpenAI,
        Anthropic, Google) have “no training” policies for paid accounts
        — but read the terms.</li>
        <li><strong>Enterprise tiers:</strong> Typically the strongest
        data protection guarantees.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="the-golden-rules">The Golden Rules</h3>
        <p><strong>1. Never enter confidential or sensitive information
        into free AI tools</strong> - Customer personal data - Financial
        information - Proprietary business data - Passwords, API keys,
        credentials - Employee personal information</p>
        <p><strong>2. Check your company’s AI policy</strong> - Many
        organisations now have AI usage policies - Some restrict which
        tools can be used - Some require enterprise accounts for work
        data - If your company doesn’t have a policy yet, ask about
        it</p>
        <p><strong>3. Never publish AI output without review</strong> -
        AI-generated content can contain errors, bias, or plagiarism -
        You are responsible for anything you send, publish, or submit —
        even if AI wrote it - “The AI wrote it” is not a defence</p>
        <p><strong>4. Be transparent about AI use</strong> - If your
        organisation or client expects original work, disclose AI
        assistance - Academic and professional contexts increasingly
        require AI disclosure - When in doubt, mention it</p>
        <h3 id="copyright-and-ownership">Copyright and Ownership</h3>
        <p>This area is evolving rapidly, but the current state:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Your prompts:</strong> You own what you write</li>
        <li><strong>AI output:</strong> Copyright status is legally
        unclear in most jurisdictions</li>
        <li><strong>Training data:</strong> AI may reproduce patterns
        from copyrighted material</li>
        <li><strong>Practical advice:</strong> Treat AI output as a
        starting point that you modify and make your own. The more you
        edit and add your expertise, the more clearly it’s your
        work.</li>

        Colleague</h3>
        <p>The most productive way to think about AI tools:</p>
        <p><strong>Think of AI as a very fast, very well-read
        intern:</strong> - Eager to help - Can produce decent first
        drafts quickly - Needs clear instructions - Makes mistakes if
        not supervised - Gets better with specific feedback - Doesn’t
        understand what it doesn’t understand</p>
        <p><strong>Don’t think of AI as:</strong> - A replacement for
        your expertise - A source of truth - An infallible calculator -
        A colleague who understands context - A system you can set and
        forget</p>

        <p><strong>The professionals who get the most from AI aren’t the
        ones who ask it to do everything — they’re the ones who know
        exactly which parts to delegate and which to keep.</strong></p>
        <h3 id="its-ok-to-be-skeptical">It’s OK to Be Skeptical</h3>
        <p>Healthy skepticism is an asset with AI tools: - Question
        outputs, especially facts and numbers - Test claims before
        relying on them - Compare AI suggestions to your own knowledge -
        Start small and build trust gradually</p>
        <p>The workshop will help you develop practical judgment about
        when to trust AI output and when to verify it.</p>

        the Workshop</h2>
        <h3 id="before-you-arrive">Before You Arrive</h3>
        <p><strong>Set up accounts (10 minutes):</strong></p>
        <p>You’ll need active accounts on at least two of these (free
        tiers are fine):</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li><strong>ChatGPT</strong> — <a
        href="https://chat.openai.com">chat.openai.com</a>
        <ul>
        <li>Create account with email</li>
        <li>Free tier is sufficient</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><strong>Claude</strong> — <a
        href="https://claude.ai">claude.ai</a>
        <ul>
        <li>Create account with email</li>
        <li>Free tier is sufficient</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><strong>Google Gemini</strong> — <a
        href="https://gemini.google.com">gemini.google.com</a>
        <ul>
        <li>Uses your Google account</li>
        <li>Free tier is sufficient</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Test your access (5 minutes):</strong> - Log in to
        each tool - Type a simple prompt: “Explain what you do in one
        sentence” - Make sure you get a response - If you’re on a
        corporate network, check that the sites aren’t blocked</p>
        <p><strong>Think about your work (5 minutes):</strong> - What’s
        one task you do every week that feels repetitive? - What’s one
        type of document you create regularly? - What’s one area where
        you wish you had a smart assistant?</p>
        <p>You’ll use these in the workshop exercises.</p>
        <h3 id="what-to-bring">What to Bring</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Laptop</strong> (not tablet — you’ll need multiple
        browser tabs open)</li>
        <li><strong>Charger</strong> (full day of screen work)</li>
        <li><strong>A real task</strong> from your work (optional but
        valuable for Exercise 4)</li>
        <li><strong>Curiosity</strong> and willingness to
        experiment</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="what-to-expect">What to Expect</h3>
        <p>The workshop is hands-on. You’ll spend most of the day
        working with AI tools, not listening to lectures. Expect to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Try things that don’t work on the first attempt</li>
        <li>See others get different results from the same tools</li>
        <li>Be surprised by what AI can do well</li>
        <li>Be equally surprised by what it gets wrong</li>
        <li>Leave with techniques you can use immediately</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>There’s no such thing as a stupid question in this
        workshop.</strong> Everyone is at a different starting point,
        and the pace is designed to challenge both beginners and
        experienced users.</p>

        <h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
        <ol type="1">
        <li><p><strong>AI tools predict the next word</strong> — they’re
        pattern-matching engines, not thinking machines. Understanding
        this changes how you use them.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Strong at drafting, weak at facts</strong> — use
        AI for structure, writing, brainstorming, and formatting. Verify
        facts, numbers, and references yourself.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Hallucination is the key risk</strong> — AI
        delivers wrong answers with total confidence. Always review
        output critically.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Context is everything</strong> — the more
        specific information you provide, the better the output. Vague
        prompts produce vague results.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Your data isn’t necessarily private</strong> —
        check your company’s AI policy and never enter sensitive
        information into free-tier tools.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>AI is a tool, not a replacement</strong> — the
        best results come from human expertise combined with AI speed.
        Know which parts to delegate.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Healthy skepticism is an asset</strong> —
        question, verify, and test. The professionals who get the most
        from AI are the ones who know its limits.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Everyone is still figuring this out</strong> —
        you’re not behind. The technology is new and evolving. The
        workshop will give you practical skills to start using it
        effectively.</p></li>
