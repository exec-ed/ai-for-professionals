        my team members, who has been a strong performer for 3 years,
        has been consistently late to work and missing deadlines for the
        past month. Other team members are starting to notice. Write me

        <p><strong>A strong participant will notice:</strong></p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li><p><strong>Tone differences</strong> — Some tools are more
        HR-procedural (“Schedule a formal meeting, document the
        conversation”), others more empathetic (“Start by checking if
        something is going on in their personal life”), others more
        direct (“Address it immediately before it affects team
        morale”).</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Structural differences</strong> — One tool might
        give a step-by-step timeline, another might give principles with
        examples, another might give a decision tree.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Content gaps</strong> — One tool might mention
        legal considerations the others don’t. Another might address the
        team dynamic while others focus only on the individual. Some
        might suggest documentation for HR purposes; others
        won’t.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Problematic advice</strong> — A tool might
        suggest being overly punitive without first understanding the
        root cause. Or it might be so gentle it doesn’t actually address
        the performance issue.</p></li>

        RTCF Prompts (One Per Scenario)</h3>
        <h4 id="scenario-1-the-difficult-client-email">Scenario 1: The
        Difficult Client Email</h4>
        <p><strong>Naive prompt (typical Round 1):</strong> &gt; “Write
        an email to a client who is unhappy with our deliverable”</p>
        <p><strong>Strong RTCF prompt (Round 2):</strong> &gt;
        <strong>Role:</strong> You are a senior project manager at a
        consulting firm who values long-term client relationships and
        communicates with confidence and empathy. &gt; &gt;
        <strong>Task:</strong> Write a reply email to David Chen, VP of
        Operations at GreenLeaf Industries, who emailed saying he’s
        “extremely disappointed” with our latest deliverable and that
        the recommendations are “too generic.” &gt; &gt;
        <strong>Context:</strong> We’ve had an 18-month engagement with
        GreenLeaf that’s been generally positive. The deliverable took 3
        weeks of work and we believe it’s solid. However, GreenLeaf had
        a board meeting recently that likely shifted their priorities —
        and we weren’t informed. I want to acknowledge his frustration
        without conceding the work is poor, and propose a 1-hour
        alignment meeting to recalibrate. &gt; &gt;
        <strong>Format:</strong> Professional but warm email. Under 200
        words. Structure: acknowledge his frustration, briefly note the
        possible misalignment, propose a specific next step (the
        alignment meeting), close with commitment to the
        relationship.</p>
        <p><strong>Why this is good:</strong> The context gives the AI
        the relationship history and the suspected root cause. The
        format prevents a generic, rambling email. The role sets the
        tone.</p>
        <hr />
        <h4 id="scenario-3-the-project-status-update">Scenario 3: The
        Project Status Update</h4>
        <p><strong>Naive prompt:</strong> &gt; “Turn these notes into a
        project status update” [pastes raw notes]</p>
        <p><strong>Strong RTCF prompt:</strong> &gt;
        <strong>Role:</strong> You are a project manager writing a
        formal weekly status update. &gt; &gt; <strong>Task:</strong>
        Convert my raw weekly notes into a structured project status
        report for the steering committee (CIO, project sponsor, 2
        business leads). &gt; &gt; <strong>Context:</strong> The project
        is a CRM migration, currently 68% complete (target was 72%).
        Data migration is 3 days behind due to duplicate records. Vendor
        hasn’t confirmed training dates. UAT is going well with 2 minor
        bugs logged. We’re $12K under budget YTD. &gt; &gt; Here are my
        raw notes: [pastes the notes from the worksheet] &gt; &gt;
        <strong>Format:</strong> Use this structure: &gt; - Overall
        status: RAG rating with one-line summary &gt; - Key achievements
        this week (bullet points) &gt; - Risks and issues (table: Risk |
        Impact | Mitigation | Owner) &gt; - Budget: one line &gt; - Next
        week’s priorities (numbered list) &gt; &gt; Keep the entire
        update under 250 words. Professional, concise tone. No surprises
        — if there’s bad news, present it with the mitigation.</p>
        <p><strong>Why this is good:</strong> Gives the AI the audience
        (steering committee), the exact format the committee expects,
        and frames how to handle bad news (with mitigation). The raw
        notes provide the content; the RTCF provides the structure and
        tone.</p>

        <h4 id="scenario-6-the-process-document">Scenario 6: The Process
        Document</h4>
        <p><strong>Naive prompt:</strong> &gt; “Write a process document
        for monthly invoicing” [pastes verbal explanation]</p>
        <p><strong>Strong RTCF prompt:</strong> &gt;
        <strong>Role:</strong> You are a technical writer who creates
        clear, step-by-step process documentation that can be followed
        by someone with no prior knowledge of the task. &gt; &gt;
        <strong>Task:</strong> Create a detailed process document for
        the monthly client invoicing process based on my verbal
        explanation below. &gt; &gt; <strong>Context:</strong> I’m the
        only person who knows this process. If I’m on leave, a colleague
        needs to be able to follow this document to complete the
        invoicing. They’ll know how to use our systems (Harvest, Excel,
        Xero, Google Sheets) but won’t know the specific steps for this
        process. Some steps have gotchas — like the purchase order
        numbers that not all clients have. &gt; &gt; Here’s my
        explanation: [pastes the verbal explanation from the worksheet]
        &gt; &gt; <strong>Format:</strong> Number each step. For each
        step include: what to do, which system to use, and any tips or
        warnings. Add a “Before You Start” section listing prerequisites
        (access needed, files to locate). Add a “Troubleshooting”
        section for common issues. Include estimated time per step.
        Total document should be printable on 2-3 pages.</p>
        <p><strong>Why this is good:</strong> The role (technical
        writer) ensures clarity for a non-expert reader. Context
        explains WHY the document exists (backup coverage), which shapes
        the level of detail. Format specifies the exact structure
        including prerequisites and troubleshooting that a naive prompt
        would miss.</p>

        <p><strong>Example of strong participant output:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>RetailFlow Customer Service — 6-Month Insight
        Brief</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Executive Summary:</strong> Analysis of 260 support
        tickets (Jul–Dec 2024) reveals that customer dissatisfaction is
        concentrated in two categories (Returns &amp; Refunds, Delivery
        Problems) and driven by slow response times, which spike on
        weekends, Mondays, and during December.</p>
        <p><strong>Top 3 Drivers of Dissatisfaction:</strong> 1.
        <strong>Returns &amp; Refunds process</strong> — Avg
        satisfaction 1.6/5 (lowest), 77% resolution rate. Customers
        submitting returns are getting the worst experience across every
        metric. 2. <strong>Delivery Problems</strong> — Avg satisfaction
        2.2/5, 77% resolution rate. Likely related to logistics
        fulfilment issues, not just the service team. 3. <strong>Slow
        response times</strong> — When response time exceeds 12 hours,
        satisfaction drops below 2.0 regardless of category. Response
        time is the universal factor.</p>
        <p><strong>When Response Times Blow Out:</strong> - Sundays:
        13.7h avg (no staff on duty) - Mondays: 9.8h avg (weekend
        backlog) - December: 13.6h avg (holiday rush) - Email channel:
        13.2h avg (3x slower than Live Chat)</p>
        <p><strong>Recommendations:</strong> 1. <strong>Fix the Returns
        process</strong> — Investigate why resolution rate is low and
        satisfaction is terrible. This is likely a process/policy
        problem, not just volume. 2. <strong>Promote Live Chat over
        Email</strong> — Live Chat averages 4h response vs Email at 13h.
        Shift customers toward the faster channel. 3. <strong>Staff for
        predictable peaks</strong> — Add weekend coverage (even light)
        and December surge capacity. Monday backlogs are
        preventable.</p>
