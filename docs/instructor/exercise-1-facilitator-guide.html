        AI Tool Test Drive — Facilitator Guide</h1>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 40 minutes (9:50-10:30 AM)
        <strong>Frameworks used:</strong> AI Task Suitability Spectrum
        <strong>Core learning:</strong> AI tools give different outputs
        for the same input — none are perfect, and knowing their
        strengths helps you choose the right one.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2 id="pre-exercise-setup">Pre-Exercise Setup</h2>
        <p><strong>Materials needed:</strong> - Participants need
        laptops with access to at least 2 AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude,
        Gemini) - Projector showing the task prompt (you’ll display
        this)</p>
        <p><strong>Room check:</strong> - Confirm wifi is working and AI
        tools are accessible - Check that participants who couldn’t set
        up accounts during intro have been helped</p>
        <p><strong>Technology fallback:</strong> - If a participant can
        only access one tool, pair them with someone who has a different
        tool — they’ll compare side by side - If wifi is shaky, reduce
        from 3 tools to 2</p>

        <h3 id="setup-5-min-950-am">Setup (5 min) — 9:50 AM</h3>
        <p><strong>Your script:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“You’ve heard me describe what AI tools can and can’t do. Now
        let’s test it. Here’s what you’re going to do:</p>
        <p>I’m about to give you a single workplace task. You’ll type
        the EXACT SAME prompt into 2 or 3 different AI tools — ChatGPT,
        Claude, Gemini, whatever you have access to. Same words, same
        task.</p>
        <p>Then compare the outputs. What’s different? What’s better?
        What’s worse? Did any of them get it wrong?</p>
        <p>This isn’t about finding the ‘best’ tool. It’s about seeing
        that these tools think differently — and that matters.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Display the task on the projector:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Your prompt (type this exactly into each
        tool):</strong></p>
        <p>“I manage a team of 8 people in a mid-sized company. One of
        my team members, who has been a strong performer for 3 years,
        has been consistently late to work and missing deadlines for the
        past month. Other team members are starting to notice. Write me
        a plan for how to address this situation.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Why this task:</strong> It’s a workplace situation
        everyone can relate to, it requires nuance (empathy
        vs. accountability), and different AI tools handle the balance
        differently. Some will be more HR-procedural, others more
        empathetic, others more direct. The differences are obvious and
        discussion-worthy.</p>
        <p><strong>Your instruction:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Type this prompt exactly as written into each of your AI
        tools. Don’t modify it — we want to see how different tools
        handle the same input. You have about 10 minutes to run the
        prompt and read the outputs. Then we’ll compare.”</p>
        </blockquote>

        — 9:55 AM</h3>
        <p><strong>Your role:</strong> Circulate the room. Look for:</p>
        <p><strong>Good signs:</strong> - Participants are reading
        outputs carefully, not just skimming - People are already
        comparing and pointing things out to neighbours - Someone
        notices a factual error or questionable advice — excellent</p>
        <p><strong>Things to prompt:</strong> - If someone finishes
        quickly: “Which response would you actually use? Why?” - If
        someone is struggling with tool access: help them quickly or
        pair them up - If someone only has one tool: “Share your screen
        with your neighbour and compare”</p>
        <p><strong>Don’t:</strong> - Get drawn into troubleshooting one
        person’s laptop for 10 minutes — pair them up and move on - Tell
        people which output is “better” — they need to form their own
        judgment</p>
        <hr />
        <h3 id="table-discussion-10-min-1005-am">Table Discussion (10
        min) — 10:05 AM</h3>
        <p><strong>Your script:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“OK, take 10 minutes at your table to compare what you got.
        Here are three questions to discuss:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li><p><strong>What was different?</strong> Look at tone,
        structure, length, and specific advice. Which tool gave the most
        practical response?</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Did any of them get something wrong — or give
        advice you wouldn’t follow?</strong> Maybe something was too
        aggressive, too passive, legally risky, or just
        generic.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Which response would you actually use as a
        starting point?</strong> Not which is ‘best’ in theory — which
        would you actually copy into a document and start
        editing?”</p></li>
        </ol>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Your role during discussion:</strong> - Visit each
        table briefly - Listen for interesting comparisons — you’ll use
        these in the debrief - If a table is quiet, prompt with: “Did
        anyone notice differences in how the tools structured the
        response?” or “Did any tool mention anything the others
        missed?”</p>
        <hr />
        <h3 id="whole-room-debrief-15-min-1015-am">Whole-Room Debrief
        (15 min) — 10:15 AM</h3>
        <p><strong>Your script:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Let’s hear what you found. I have three questions for the
        room.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Question 1: “What surprised you?”</strong></p>
        <p>Listen for: - “They were more different than I expected” -
        “One was really formal, another was more conversational” - “One
        gave a step-by-step plan, another was more principles-based” -
        “One mentioned legal considerations the others didn’t”</p>
        <p><strong>Your move:</strong> Draw out 3-4 observations.
        Connect them: “So the same prompt produced meaningfully
        different advice. That’s important — the tool you choose affects
        the output you get.”</p>
        <p><strong>Question 2: “Did any tool give bad
        advice?”</strong></p>
        <p>Listen for: - Overly aggressive suggestions (fire them
        immediately) - Missing the human element (no mention of checking
        if something is wrong) - Generic HR-speak that wouldn’t work in
        practice - Confidently wrong information about employment law or
        procedure</p>
        <p><strong>Your move:</strong> If someone caught an error or bad
        advice, spotlight it. This is the hallucination / overconfidence
        lesson in action.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“This is exactly why the first framework matters — the AI
        Task Suitability Spectrum. This people-management scenario sits
        in the Human-Led, AI-Supported zone. AI can help you think
        through the situation and draft a plan — but the conversation
        itself, the empathy, reading the room? That’s Human-Only.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Question 3: “If you could only use one tool going
        forward, which would you pick and why?”</strong></p>
        <p>Listen for: - Different people preferring different tools
        (this is normal and useful) - Reasons related to tone,
        structure, or accuracy (all valid)</p>
        <p><strong>Your move:</strong> Normalise tool preference.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“There’s no objectively ‘best’ tool. Different tools suit
        different tasks and different people. What matters is that you
        try a few, find what works for your type of work, and —
        critically — never assume the first output is ready to use.”</p>

        <h3 id="bridge-to-session-2">Bridge to Session 2</h3>
        <p><strong>Your script:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“You just saw what happens when you give AI a prompt without
        any special technique — you get something usable but imperfect,
        and different tools give different results.</p>
        <p>After the break, we’re going to learn how to dramatically
        improve what you get back. The difference between a lazy prompt
        and a structured one is night and day. You’ll experience it
        yourself.”</p>
