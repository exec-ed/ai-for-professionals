        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 45 minutes (1:45-2:30 PM)
        <strong>Frameworks used:</strong> AI-Assisted Analysis Workflow,
        RTCF Prompt Framework <strong>Core learning:</strong> AI can
        accelerate data analysis significantly, but verification is
        non-negotiable — AI makes errors with data and you must catch
        them.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2 id="pre-exercise-setup">Pre-Exercise Setup</h2>
        <p><strong>Materials needed:</strong> - Data Analysis Worksheet
        (1 per participant, printed) - RetailFlow CSV dataset —
        distribute digitally (email, shared drive, USB, or course
        website) - Projector showing the 3 business questions</p>
        <p><strong>Distribute the CSV during the lecture (1:15-1:45),
        not during exercise time.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Your script for CSV distribution:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“While I’m talking, I’m sending you a file — the RetailFlow
        customer service dataset. It’s a CSV with 260 support tickets
        from July to December 2024. Check your email [or shared drive /
        USB] and make sure you have it. You’ll need it in about 20
        minutes.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Technology check:</strong> - Confirm participants
        know how to upload files to their AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, and
        Gemini all accept CSV uploads on paid tiers; for free tiers,
        copy/paste works) - If some participants can’t upload, they can
        copy the first 100 rows and paste directly into the chat</p>

        <h2 id="whats-in-the-dataset-facilitator-only">What’s in the

        <p>The CSV has deliberate patterns baked in. You need to know

        findings.</p>

        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><strong>Long response times (cross-cutting)</strong></td>

        significantly regardless of category</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>

        <p>Other patterns: Billing Queries have moderate dissatisfaction
        (~2.8), while Order Tracking (~3.9) and Product Information
        (~3.9) are the best performers.</p>
        <p><strong>Question 2 — When do response times blow

        <p><strong>Question 3 — Recommendations (reasonable answers
        include):</strong></p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li><strong>Shift volume from Email to Live Chat</strong> — Live
        Chat is 3x faster and has better satisfaction. Promote Live Chat
        option, reduce email response dependency.</li>
        <li><strong>Staff for Mondays and December</strong> —
        Predictable demand spikes need staffing adjustments, not just
        awareness.</li>
        <li><strong>Fix the Returns &amp; Refunds process</strong> —
        Lowest satisfaction AND lowest resolution rate. Likely a process
        problem, not just a volume problem.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Sunday coverage</strong> — Even a small weekend
        team would prevent the Monday backlog.</li>
        <li><strong>Investigate Delivery Problems</strong> —
        Second-worst satisfaction, likely needs coordination with
        logistics/fulfilment.</li>

        PM</h3>
        <p><strong>Your role:</strong> Circulate actively. This is the
        exercise where participants need the most hands-on guidance.</p>
        <p><strong>First 5 minutes — check uploads:</strong> - Make sure
        everyone has the data in their AI tool - Help anyone struggling
        with upload (copy/paste fallback if needed) - Common issue:
        free-tier tools may not accept file uploads — have participants
        copy the header row + first 50-100 rows</p>
        <p><strong>Minutes 5-15 — monitor analysis quality:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>What good looks like:</strong> - Participant asks AI
        to describe the dataset first (orientation step) - Follows up
        with progressively deeper questions - Writes findings on the
        worksheet as they go - Cross-references an AI claim with their
        own check</p>
        <p><strong>What to prompt:</strong> - If someone is just reading
        AI output passively: “What did it find? Do you believe it? Check
        one number.” - If someone jumped straight to recommendations
        without analysis: “Slow down — what patterns did you find
        first?” - If someone is stuck: “Start simple: ask for average
        satisfaction by category. That’ll give you something to work
        with.” - If someone finishes early: “Can you find patterns the
        AI missed? Try: ‘What happens when you look at the combination
        of day of week AND channel?’”</p>
        <p><strong>Minutes 15-25 — push toward verification and
        presentation:</strong> - “Have you verified any of the AI’s
        findings yet?” - “Start formatting your brief — ask the AI to
        create a one-page summary for Karen.”</p>

        <h3 id="debrief-10-min-215-pm">Debrief (10 min) — 2:15 PM</h3>
        <p><strong>Question 1: “What were the top drivers of
        dissatisfaction?”</strong></p>
        <p>Listen for: Returns &amp; Refunds, Delivery Problems, and
        long response times.</p>
        <p><strong>Your move:</strong> If most groups found the same
        things, validate it. If groups found different things, explore
        why: “Interesting — different AI tools or different prompts led
        to different findings. Who’s right? How would you decide?”</p>
        <p><strong>Key teaching point:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Most of you found the same core patterns — Returns &amp;
        Refunds and Delivery Problems are clearly the worst categories.
        But here’s the deeper finding: response time is a cross-cutting
        driver. Even in ‘good’ categories, when response times blow out,
        satisfaction tanks. The AI that spotted that connection gave the
        most useful analysis.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Question 2: “When do response times blow
        out?”</strong></p>
        <p>Listen for: Sundays, Mondays, December, Email channel.</p>
        <p><strong>Your move:</strong> Draw the picture:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“So we have a staffing pattern problem: nobody works Sunday,
        so tickets pile up. Monday is catch-up day. December is peak
        season with no extra capacity. And Email is the slowest channel
        by far. These are all fixable — they’re operational decisions,
        not mysteries.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Question 3: “Did anyone catch the AI getting
        something wrong?”</strong></p>
        <p><strong>This is the most important debrief question.</strong>
        If someone caught an error, spend time on it.</p>
        <p><strong>Your move:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“This is the whole point of Step 4 in the workflow — Verify.
        AI is fast and it finds real patterns. But it also miscounts,
        confuses correlation with causation, and sometimes invents
        things. Your job is to be the quality control layer. AI does the
        heavy lifting; you check the work.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>If no one caught an error, ask: “Did anyone verify a specific
        number? What did you check, and was it right?” If nobody
        verified, that’s a teaching moment too:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Here’s the honest truth: if you didn’t verify, you don’t
        actually know if those findings are correct. You have an
        analysis that looks professional and sounds convincing — but it
        might be wrong. The discipline of checking is what separates
        useful AI-assisted analysis from dangerous AI-assisted
        analysis.”</p>

        <h3 id="bridge-to-afternoon-tea">Bridge to Afternoon Tea</h3>
        <p><strong>Your script:</strong></p>

        <p>“You just did in 25 minutes what would have taken a few hours
        manually — and the quality is decent if you verified the
        findings. That’s the promise of AI for data work. Not perfect,
        but fast, and good enough as a starting point when you add human
        verification.</p>
