        id="exercise-4-your-ai-enhanced-workflow-facilitator-guide">Exercise
        4: Your AI-Enhanced Workflow — Facilitator Guide</h1>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 40 minutes (3:20-4:00 PM)
        <strong>Frameworks used:</strong> AI Opportunity Finder, RTCF
        Prompt Framework, AI Task Suitability Spectrum <strong>Core
        learning:</strong> AI fits into specific parts of real work —
        the skill is knowing which parts to delegate and which to
        keep.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2 id="pre-exercise-setup">Pre-Exercise Setup</h2>
        <p><strong>Materials needed:</strong> - Workflow Mapping
        Template (1 per participant, printed) - Frameworks Reference
        Sheet (already distributed — they’ll use the Opportunity
        Finder)</p>
        <p><strong>No technology setup needed</strong> — participants
        use whatever AI tool they prefer from earlier exercises.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2 id="why-this-exercise-matters">Why This Exercise
        Matters</h2>
        <p>This is the exercise that makes the day personal. Exercises
        1-3 used supplied scenarios and data. Exercise 4 uses the
        participant’s own job. This is where they go from “I understand
        how AI works” to “I know what I’ll do with it.”</p>
        <p>It’s also the exercise where some participants freeze.
        Choosing a real task and redesigning it feels higher-stakes than
        working through a practice scenario. Be ready to help with task
        selection.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2 id="the-exercise">The Exercise</h2>
        <h3 id="setup-5-min-315-pm">Setup (5 min) — 3:15 PM</h3>
        <p>Distribute the Workflow Mapping Template (if not already
        distributed).</p>
        <p><strong>Your script:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Everything today has used our scenarios and our data. This
        exercise is about you.</p>
        <p>Here’s what you’re going to do: pick one task you do at least
        weekly that takes 30 minutes or more. Something you find
        repetitive or time-consuming. Then you’ll map out how you do it
        today — every step. And then you’ll redesign that workflow with
        AI at the steps where it adds value.</p>
        <p>This isn’t theoretical. By the end, you should have a
        before-and-after diagram of a real task from your real job — and
        you’ll have tested at least one step live.</p>
        <p>Take 2 minutes right now to choose your task. If you’re
        stuck, I have suggestions.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <hr />
        <h3 id="helping-with-task-selection">Helping with Task
        Selection</h3>
        <p><strong>This is where participants get stuck most.</strong>
        Have these prompts ready:</p>
        <p><strong>If someone says “I don’t know what to
        pick”:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Think about your last week. What task made you think ‘I wish
        I didn’t have to do this again’? Or what took longer than it
        should have?”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>If someone picks something too simple</strong> (e.g.,
        “sending an email”):</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“That’s a good start, but let’s find something with more
        steps. What about the whole process around that email? What do
        you do before writing it and after sending it?”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>If someone picks something too complex</strong>
        (e.g., “our entire quarterly planning process”):</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“That’s a great long-term project. For today, let’s zoom into
        one piece of it — maybe the part where you gather data, or the
        part where you write the summary. Which piece is most
        repetitive?”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Common good choices:</strong> - Writing a weekly
        status report / team update - Preparing meeting agendas or
        minutes - Creating monthly reports from raw data - Onboarding
        documentation for new hires - Compiling information from
        multiple sources for a briefing - Processing and responding to a
        batch of similar requests - Preparing a slide deck from meeting
        notes</p>

        <h3 id="part-1-map-10-min-320-pm">Part 1: Map (10 min) — 3:20
        PM</h3>
        <p><strong>Your script:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Map your current workflow. Write every step in the table on
        your worksheet — what you do, what tool you use, and roughly how
        long each step takes. Be honest and specific. Include the boring
        parts — the copying, the formatting, the switching between
        systems.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Your role:</strong> Circulate and check that: - Tasks
        are specific enough (not “do my job” but “create the weekly
        client report”) - Steps are granular (not “write the report” but
        “pull data from CRM, open template, copy numbers into table,
        write commentary, format, email to team”) - Time estimates are
        reasonable</p>
        <p><strong>Common prompt:</strong> “Is there a step you’re
        forgetting? What about the setup at the beginning or the
        follow-up at the end?”</p>
        <hr />
        <h3 id="part-2-redesign-15-min-330-pm">Part 2: Redesign (15 min)
        — 3:30 PM</h3>
        <p><strong>Your script:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Now go through each step and classify it using the AI
        Opportunity Finder on your reference sheet. Is this step
        something to Automate, Assist, Generate, Analyse, or is it
        Human-Only?</p>
        <p>Then redesign the workflow. For each step where AI helps,
        note what tool you’d use and what you’d ask it to do. Use RTCF
        if you’re writing a prompt.</p>
        <p>Be realistic. Not every step needs AI. Some steps are
        Human-Only and should stay that way.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Your role:</strong> This is the most
        coaching-intensive part of the day.</p>
        <p><strong>What to watch for:</strong></p>

        <td>Participant is stuck on redesign</td>

        </table>
        <p><strong>Key coaching move:</strong> Check that every
        redesigned workflow has at least one human review/verification
        step. If someone has AI generating a client email with no human
        review before it sends, flag it: “What happens if the AI gets
        the tone wrong?”</p>

        <p>“Pick one step — the most promising AI-assisted step in your
        new workflow. Try it right now, for real. Write the prompt using
        RTCF, run it, and see what you get. You have 10 minutes.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Your role:</strong> Move quickly between tables. Help
        with prompt-writing if needed, but mostly observe.</p>
        <p><strong>What you’re looking for:</strong> - Participants are
        applying RTCF without being reminded (it’s internalised) - The
        output is relevant to their actual work (not generic) -
        Participants are evaluating the output critically (not just
        accepting it)</p>
        <p><strong>If someone gets a great result:</strong> “Would this
        have taken you less time than doing it manually? How much
        less?”</p>
        <p><strong>If someone gets a poor result:</strong> “What’s
        missing from the output? Can you improve the prompt? This is
        exactly the iteration skill from Exercise 2.”</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>“Quick round — 2 minutes each. Tell your table: 1. What’s the
        task? 2. Which step did you redesign with AI? 3. What happened
        when you tested it? 4. What will you try at work this week?</p>
        <p>One person per table, volunteer — go.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Your role:</strong> Listen for strong examples you
        can reference in the wrap-up. If time permits and there’s a
        particularly compelling before/after, ask that person to share
        with the whole room (30 seconds).</p>
        <p><strong>Don’t</strong> force everyone to present. Volunteers
        only. The lightning format keeps energy up.</p>
