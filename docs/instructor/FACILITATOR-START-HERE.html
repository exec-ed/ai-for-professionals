        <p>This is a <strong>hands-on skills workshop</strong>, not a
        strategic masterclass. The other two courses in the series teach
        executives where to invest in AI and how to manage AI projects.

        <em>“Here’s what I’ll use AI for, here’s how I’ll prompt it, and
        here’s where I’ll keep a human in the loop.”</em></p>

        <h2 id="facilitation-philosophy">Facilitation Philosophy</h2>
        <h3 id="this-is-a-workshop-not-a-lecture">This Is a Workshop,
        Not a Lecture</h3>
        <p>Your lecture segments total about 2 hours across the day. The
        other 5+ hours are exercises, discussion, and hands-on practice.
        Resist the urge to extend lecture time.</p>
        <h3 id="core-principles">Core Principles</h3>
        <p><strong>1. Let them experience it first, then explain
        why.</strong> Don’t teach RTCF as theory — have them write bad
        prompts first (Round 1), feel the pain, then introduce the
        framework (Round 2). The contrast teaches better than any
        slide.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Mistakes are the curriculum.</strong> When
        someone’s AI hallucinates or gives a terrible answer, that’s not
        a failure — it’s the best teaching moment of the day. Celebrate
        it. “This is exactly what we need to see.”</p>
        <p><strong>3. Meet them where they are.</strong> The room will
        have people who’ve used ChatGPT daily for a year alongside
        people who’ve never opened it. Your job is to make both groups
        feel challenged. Use stretch challenges for advanced
        participants and pair beginners with more experienced users.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Make it about their real work.</strong> Every
        exercise connects to real tasks from their jobs. Exercise 4 is
        explicitly about their own workflow. Keep pulling the thread:
        “How would you use this at your desk on Monday?”</p>
        <p><strong>5. You don’t need to be an AI expert.</strong> You
        need to be a good facilitator who understands the frameworks. If
        an AI tool does something unexpected, use it: “Interesting — why
        do we think it did that?” You’re modelling good AI practice by
        not pretending to have all the answers.</p>

        <p><strong>Key teaching points for the lecture:</strong> -
        “Garbage in, garbage out” applies to AI more than anything -
        RTCF: Role, Task, Context, Format — a repeatable structure -
        Show a live before/after demo: write a bad prompt, get bad
        output, rewrite with RTCF, get good output - Common mistakes:
        too vague, no context, no format, not iterating - Context
        windows: what they are, why they matter</p>
        <p><strong>Live demo suggestion:</strong> Pick Scenario 3
        (project status update) from the worksheet. Show a naive prompt
        and the output, then rewrite it with RTCF live in front of the
        room. The contrast is immediate and convincing.</p>
        <p><strong>Transition to Exercise 2:</strong> “I just showed you
        the difference RTCF makes. Now it’s your turn. You have 6

        <p><strong>Key teaching points for the lecture:</strong> -
        Define the question BEFORE you touch the tool (Prepare step) -
        Progressive questioning: start broad, go deeper - Verification
        is non-negotiable — AI makes arithmetic and logic errors with
        data - Privacy: what data should never go into free AI tools -
        The 6-step workflow: Prepare → Upload → Question → Verify →
        Refine → Present</p>
        <p><strong>Energy management:</strong> This is the post-lunch

        <li><p>The <strong>Analysis Workflow</strong> tells you how to

        <p>The key principle across all four: <strong>AI is a tool, not
        a colleague. You own the output and the decisions.</strong>”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Action planning:</strong> - Distribute the Personal
        Action Plan template - Give them 10 minutes of quiet time to
        fill it in — don’t talk over this - Ask 2-3 volunteers to share
        their “this week” commitment - End with course feedback form and
        next-in-series pointers</p>
        <p><strong>Closing script:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“You’re not going to be an AI expert tomorrow. But you have
        something better — a framework for getting started and a
        realistic sense of what these tools can and can’t do. Start
        small. Pick one thing. Try it this week. Build from there.”</p>

        id="ive-already-been-using-chatgpt-for-months-this-is-too-basic">“I’ve
        already been using ChatGPT for months — this is too basic”</h3>
        <p><strong>Your move:</strong> Acknowledge their experience and
        make them a resource.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“That’s great — you’ll get through the basics quickly. I’d
        love you to help others at your table who are newer to this. And
        in each exercise, there are stretch challenges designed for
        exactly your level.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In Exercise 2, ask them to try the advanced techniques. In
        Exercise 3, ask them to find patterns beyond the three
        questions. In Exercise 4, ask them to tackle a more complex
        workflow.</p>
        <h3 id="ive-never-used-any-ai-tool-before-im-lost">“I’ve never
        used any AI tool before — I’m lost”</h3>
        <p><strong>Your move:</strong> Normalise it and pair them.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“That’s exactly who this workshop is for. Let’s make sure
        you’re set up, and I’ll pair you with someone at your table who
        can help with the mechanics while you focus on learning.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Check their account access during Exercise 1. If they’re
        stuck on setup, troubleshoot quickly — don’t let tech issues eat
        into their learning time.</p>
        <h3 id="ai-just-gave-me-completely-wrong-information">“AI just
        gave me completely wrong information”</h3>
        <p><strong>Your move:</strong> Celebrate it.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Perfect — this is exactly what we need to see. Can you show
        the group? This is hallucination in action. The AI sounds
        confident but it’s wrong. This is why verification matters.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Use it as a live teaching moment. Ask the group: “How would
        you know this was wrong if you didn’t already know the
        answer?”</p>
        <h3 id="isnt-ai-going-to-take-our-jobs">“Isn’t AI going to take
        our jobs?”</h3>
        <p><strong>Your move:</strong> Address it honestly without
        dismissing the concern.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“It’s a fair question. Here’s what we’re seeing: AI is
        changing jobs, not eliminating most of them. The tasks that are
        routine and pattern-based — yes, AI will handle more of those.
        But the judgment, creativity, relationships, and ethical
        decisions? Those stay human. Today is about making sure you’re
        the professional who knows how to work WITH AI, not the one who
        gets surprised by it.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3 id="my-company-doesnt-allow-us-to-use-chatgpt">“My company
        doesn’t allow us to use ChatGPT”</h3>
        <p><strong>Your move:</strong> Validate the policy and
        redirect.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“That’s actually responsible of your organisation. Data
        privacy is serious, and we’ll talk about that today. For now,
        you can use the tools here for the workshop exercises — we’re
        using practice scenarios, not real company data. Take notes on
        the techniques, and when you’re back at work, check with your IT
        team about which tools are approved.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3 id="the-wifi-is-down-ai-tool-isnt-loading">“The wifi is down
        / AI tool isn’t loading”</h3>
        <p><strong>Your move:</strong> Pair up.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Share with your neighbour for now — one person drives, the
        other navigates. Some of the best learning happens when two
        people discuss what to prompt.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>If venue wifi is unreliable, have a mobile hotspot as backup.

        <p><strong>Your move:</strong> Use table-level
        differentiation.</p>
        <p>Seat experienced users with beginners (if you can control
        seating). Give advanced participants explicit stretch
        challenges. Check in with struggling participants individually
