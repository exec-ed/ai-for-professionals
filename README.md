## Session Details

### Session 1: AI Foundations & Orientation (9:00-10:30)

**9:00-9:15 — Welcome & Introductions (15 min)**
- Course overview and objectives
- Participant introductions: name, role, "one thing you've tried with AI"
- Set expectations: this is a workshop, not a lecture

**9:15-9:50 — What AI Actually Is (35 min)**
- Demystifying AI: what's happening "under the hood" (conceptual, not technical)
- Types of AI tools professionals encounter: chatbots, copilots, generators, analysers
- What AI is good at vs. what it's bad at
- **Framework 1: AI Task Suitability Spectrum** — a mental model for deciding when to use AI

**9:50-10:30 — Exercise 1: AI Tool Test Drive (40 min)**
- Same workplace task across 3 AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)
- Compare outputs: quality, style, accuracy, hallucinations
- Group discussion: what surprised you? What would you trust? What wouldn't you?
- **Output:** Personal notes on tool strengths and preferred tool for different tasks

---

### Morning Tea (10:30-11:00)

---

### Session 2: Prompt & Context Engineering (11:00-12:30)

**11:00-11:30 — The Art of Effective Prompting (30 min)**
- Why "garbage in, garbage out" applies to AI
- **Framework 2: RTCF Prompt Framework**
  - **Role** — Who should the AI be? (e.g., "You are an experienced financial analyst")
  - **Task** — What should it do? (e.g., "Summarise this quarterly report")
  - **Context** — What background does it need? (e.g., "This is for a board presentation")
  - **Format** — How should the output look? (e.g., "3 bullet points, executive language")
- Common prompt patterns: chain-of-thought, few-shot examples, iterative refinement
- Anti-patterns: vague instructions, missing context, not specifying constraints
- Context windows: what they are, why they matter, how to work within them

**11:30-12:30 — Exercise 2: Prompt Engineering Workshop (60 min)**
- **Round 1 — Baseline (15 min):** Attempt 3 workplace scenarios with naive prompts, note results
- **Round 2 — Apply RTCF (20 min):** Redo the same scenarios using the framework, compare improvement
- **Round 3 — Advanced Techniques (15 min):** Chain-of-thought reasoning, iterative refinement, multi-turn conversations
- **Debrief (10 min):** Share best prompts, discuss what worked and why
- **Output:** Personal prompt template library for common work tasks

**Workplace Scenarios (participants choose 3):**
1. Draft a professional email responding to a difficult client
2. Summarise a long policy document into key points
3. Create a project status update from raw notes
4. Generate interview questions for a specific role
5. Analyse pros and cons of a business decision
6. Write a process document from a verbal explanation

- Privacy and confidentiality: what data should never go into AI tools

**1:45-2:30 — Exercise 3: Data Analysis Challenge (45 min)**
- Provided dataset: RetailFlow customer service data (CSV)
  - 6 months of ticket data: volume, response times, categories, satisfaction scores
- **Task:** Use AI to answer 3 business questions:
  1. What are the top 3 drivers of customer dissatisfaction?
  2. Are there patterns in when response times blow out?
  3. What would you recommend to the customer service manager?
- Work individually or in pairs
- **Debrief (10 min):** Compare findings across groups — did AI give everyone the same answers?
- **Output:** A one-page insight brief generated with AI assistance

  - Microsoft 365 Copilot, Google Workspace AI, Notion AI
  - Automation platforms: Zapier, Make, Power Automate
  - Specialist tools: AI for writing, presentations, spreadsheets, meeting notes
- **Framework 4: AI Opportunity Finder**
  - **High-volume, repetitive** — emails, scheduling, data entry → automate
  - **Information synthesis** — research, summaries, meeting notes → AI-assist
  - **Content generation** — drafts, reports, presentations → AI-draft, human-edit
  - **Analysis & patterns** — data review, trend spotting, anomaly detection → AI-analyse
- Identifying the "low-hanging fruit" in your own role
- Responsible use: company policies, data governance, human oversight

**3:20-4:00 — Exercise 4: Your AI-Enhanced Workflow (40 min)**
- **Part 1 — Map (10 min):** Pick one recurring weekly task from your role. Map the current steps.
- **Part 2 — Redesign (15 min):** Redesign the workflow with AI assistance at each applicable step. Use the AI Opportunity Finder to identify where AI adds value.
- **Part 3 — Test (10 min):** If time permits, try one step live with an AI tool

- **This month:** What workflow will you redesign with AI?
- **This quarter:** What AI skill will you develop further?
- Course feedback
- Pointer to next courses in the series: Business Innovation and Leadership & PM

## The 4 Practical Frameworks

### Framework 1: AI Task Suitability Spectrum
**What:** A mental model for quickly assessing whether a task is suitable for AI assistance
**When taught:** 9:15-9:50 AM (35 min)
**Practiced:** Exercise 1 — AI Tool Test Drive (9:50-10:30 AM, 40 min)

**Four zones:**
- **AI-Led** — Routine, high-volume, pattern-based tasks (drafting, summarising, formatting)
- **AI-Assisted** — Tasks requiring judgment but benefiting from AI support (analysis, research, editing)
- **Human-Led, AI-Supported** — Complex tasks where AI handles sub-tasks (strategy, design, negotiation prep)
- **Human-Only** — Tasks requiring empathy, ethics, relationships, or novel judgment (performance reviews, crisis leadership, creative vision)

**Key question:** *"Where does this task sit on the spectrum, and what does AI handle vs. what do I handle?"*

---

### Framework 2: RTCF Prompt Framework
**What:** A repeatable structure for writing effective prompts
**When taught:** 11:00-11:30 AM (30 min)
**Practiced:** Exercise 2 — Prompt Engineering Workshop (11:30-12:30 PM, 60 min)

**Four components:**
- **Role** — Set the AI's expertise and perspective
- **Task** — Define the specific action clearly
- **Context** — Provide relevant background and constraints
- **Format** — Specify the desired output structure

**Key principle:** *"The quality of your output is directly proportional to the quality of your input."*

---

### Framework 3: AI-Assisted Analysis Workflow
**What:** A systematic 6-step process for using AI to analyse data
**When taught:** 1:15-1:45 PM (30 min)
**Practiced:** Exercise 3 — Data Analysis Challenge (1:45-2:30 PM, 45 min)

**Six steps:**
1. **Prepare** — Define the question before touching the tool
2. **Upload** — Get data into the AI appropriately
3. **Question** — Ask progressively deeper questions
4. **Verify** — Cross-check against what you know
5. **Refine** — Iterate based on findings
6. **Present** — Format for your audience

**Key principle:** *"AI finds patterns fast, but humans decide what patterns mean."*

---

### Framework 4: AI Opportunity Finder
**What:** A classification model for spotting AI opportunities in daily work
**When taught:** 3:00-3:20 PM (20 min)
**Practiced:** Exercise 4 — Your AI-Enhanced Workflow (3:20-4:00 PM, 40 min)

**Four opportunity types:**
- **Automate** — High-volume, repetitive tasks
- **Assist** — Information synthesis and research
- **Generate** — Content drafting and creation
- **Analyse** — Data review and pattern detection

**Key question:** *"Which parts of my weekly work are high-volume, synthesis-heavy, content-heavy, or data-heavy?"*

## Integration with RetailFlow

**Different from the other two courses:**

| | AI for Professionals | Business Innovation | Leadership & PM |
|---|---|---|---|
| **RetailFlow use** | Dataset for analysis practice | Strategic investment decisions | Operational project management |
| **What participants see** | Customer service CSV data | Company financials & AI initiatives | Live pilot with crises |
| **Depth** | Surface (data exercise) | Strategic (portfolio allocation) | Deep (full case simulation) |

**RetailFlow in Exercise 3 (Data Analysis):**
- Participants receive a CSV of 6 months of customer service data
- They use AI tools to find patterns, generate insights, and make recommendations
- This is the same company they'll encounter in the other two courses
- Builds familiarity for participants who continue the series

---

## Key Difference from Other Courses

This course is deliberately **personal and practical** where the other two are **strategic and organisational**:

- No investment decisions (that's Business Innovation)
- No project management (that's Leadership & PM)
- No frameworks for leading teams or managing stakeholders
- **Pure focus:** "How do I, personally, use AI better in my job starting Monday?"

The gap this fills: participants in the Leadership and Innovation courses consistently requested more hands-on, "how-to" AI skills training. This course delivers exactly that, and allows the other courses to stay focused on strategy and leadership.
