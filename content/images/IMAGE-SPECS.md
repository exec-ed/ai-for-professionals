## Required Images

### 1. welcome-human-ai-collaboration.png
**Slide:** Welcome
**Depicts:** A professional at a desk working alongside AI — laptop screen showing a chat interface, person thinking/reviewing. Collaborative mood, not futuristic or sci-fi. Modern office setting.
**Style:** Warm, inviting, inclusive. Multiple professionals of different backgrounds if possible.

### 2. ai-pattern-matching.png
**Slide:** What AI Actually Is
**Depicts:** Visual metaphor for pattern-matching: input text flowing through a network/web of connections to produce output text. Should convey "predicting the next word" rather than "thinking." Could show a sequence of words with probability weightings.
**Style:** Conceptual/diagrammatic. Clean, not cluttered.

### 3. task-suitability-spectrum.png
**Slide:** Framework 1: AI Task Suitability Spectrum
**Depicts:** Horizontal spectrum/gradient with four labelled zones:
- Left (blue): AI-Led
- Centre-left (teal): AI-Assisted
- Centre-right (amber): Human-Led, AI-Supported
- Right (orange): Human-Only
With icons or small illustrations for each zone. Arrow showing "More AI" on left, "More Human" on right.
**Style:** Framework diagram. Clean, printable, reusable on reference sheet.

### 4. tool-comparison.png
**Slide:** Exercise 1: AI Tool Test Drive
**Depicts:** Three browser windows or chat interfaces side by side (representing ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) showing different outputs for the same input. Visual emphasis on the differences.
**Style:** Illustrated/schematic, not a screenshot. Should convey "compare and contrast."

### 5. garbage-in-garbage-out.png
**Slide:** The Art of Effective Prompting
**Depicts:** Two paths: Left path shows vague input → mediocre output. Right path shows structured input (labelled R, T, C, F) → excellent output. Funnel or pipeline visual metaphor.
**Style:** Before/after comparison. Clear visual contrast between the two paths.

### 6. prompt-workshop.png
**Slide:** Exercise 2: Prompt Engineering Workshop
**Depicts:** Three ascending steps or rounds labelled "Round 1: Baseline," "Round 2: RTCF," "Round 3: Advanced" — conveying skill progression. Could show quality bars increasing.
**Style:** Progress/improvement visual. Energetic.

### 7. data-analysis-workflow.png
**Slide:** Framework 3: AI-Assisted Analysis Workflow
**Depicts:** Six connected steps in a linear flow:
Prepare → Upload → Question → Verify → Refine → Present
Each step with a small icon. The "Verify" step should be visually emphasised (larger, highlighted, or with a checkmark).
**Style:** Process diagram. Clean, printable, reusable on reference sheet.

### 8. data-challenge.png
**Slide:** Exercise 3: Data Analysis Challenge
**Depicts:** A spreadsheet/CSV visual with data rows, alongside an AI chat interface showing analysis output (chart or summary). Person reviewing both.
**Style:** Hands-on, practical mood. Shows the human-AI interaction with data.

### 9. ai-landscape.png
**Slide:** AI Beyond Chat
**Depicts:** A landscape/ecosystem diagram showing AI tools in categories:
- Centre: Chat tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)
- Surrounding: Productivity (Copilot, Google AI), Automation (Zapier, Make), Specialist (Grammarly, Otter)
Conveying that chat is just one part of a broader AI ecosystem.
**Style:** Ecosystem/map visual. Not exhaustive — representative.

### 10. priority-matrix.png
**Slide:** Start with Quick Wins
**Depicts:** 2x2 matrix with axes "Effort" (low to high) and "Time Saved" (low to high). Four quadrants labelled: Quick Wins (top-left, highlighted), Big Wins (top-right), Low Priority (bottom-left), Worth It Later (bottom-right).
**Style:** Classic 2x2 matrix. The "Quick Wins" quadrant should be visually emphasised (colour, star, arrow).

### 11. workflow-redesign.png
**Slide:** Exercise 4: Your AI-Enhanced Workflow
**Depicts:** A before/after workflow diagram. Left side: manual steps (all person icons). Right side: redesigned workflow (mix of person and AI icons, with AI icons at specific steps). Arrow or transformation visual between them.
**Style:** Process transformation visual. Should convey "your workflow, improved."

### 12. four-frameworks.png
**Slide:** What You Built Today
**Depicts:** Four frameworks arranged as a toolkit or connected system:
1. Suitability Spectrum (WHEN)
2. RTCF (HOW)
3. Analysis Workflow (DATA)
4. Opportunity Finder (WHERE)
With connecting arrows showing how they work together.
**Style:** Synthesis/summary visual. Should feel like "a complete toolkit."

### 13. action-plan.png
**Slide:** Your Action Plan
**Depicts:** Three time horizons: This Week → This Month → This Quarter. Could be stepping stones, a growth path, or a timeline. Conveys building momentum from a small first step.
**Style:** Growth/momentum visual. Encouraging, forward-looking.

### 14. qr-feedback.png
**Slide:** Thank You
**Depicts:** QR code linking to the course feedback form.
**Note:** Generate from actual feedback form URL when available. Placeholder until URL is set.
