# Welcome

![](./images/welcome-human-ai-collaboration.png)

::: {.notes}
- "Welcome to Practical AI for Professionals"
- "Today is about doing, not just listening"
- "By the end of today, you'll have real skills you can use at your desk on Monday morning"
- "This isn't a course for executives deciding where to invest in AI, and it's not for project managers leading AI projects. Those are the other two courses in this series."
- "This course is for YOU — a professional who wants to use AI tools effectively in your daily work."
:::

# About Today

**This is a workshop, not a lecture.**

- You'll spend most of the day with your hands on a keyboard
- You'll use real AI tools on real tasks
- You'll make mistakes — that's where the learning happens
- You'll leave with techniques you can apply immediately

::: {.notes}
- "Look around the room. Some of you have been using ChatGPT for months. Some of you opened it for the first time yesterday. Both are fine."
- "The exercises are designed so everyone can participate regardless of starting point"
- "If you're experienced, there are stretch challenges. If you're new, the basics are powerful."
- "One ground rule: there are no stupid questions. The technology is new and everyone is figuring it out."
:::

- "The morning builds skills, the afternoon applies them to your real job"
:::

---

# What You'll Learn

**Four frameworks. Four exercises. One day.**

1. **Know when** to use AI → AI Task Suitability Spectrum
2. **Know how** to talk to AI → RTCF Prompt Framework
3. **Know how** to use AI with data → AI-Assisted Analysis Workflow
4. **Know where** AI fits in your work → AI Opportunity Finder

::: {.notes}
- "These aren't academic frameworks. They're practical tools."
- "By 4:30 you'll have used each one at least once"
- "You'll also have a personal prompt library and a redesigned workflow from your own job"
- "Let's start with the foundation: what is AI, really?"
:::

---

# What AI Actually Is

![](./images/ai-pattern-matching.png)

::: {.notes}
**The Simple Truth: AI Predicts the Next Word**

- "When you type something into ChatGPT or Claude, the AI isn't thinking. It's predicting."
- "It's been trained on billions of pages of text, and it's learned patterns — what word comes after what, what sentences follow what questions, what format fits what request"
- "Think of it as autocomplete on steroids"
- "Your phone predicts one word at a time. These tools predict thousands of words at a time."
- "The result often LOOKS like understanding — but it's pattern-matching"
- "Why does this matter? Because it tells you what AI is good at and what it's bad at."
:::

---

# What AI Is Good At

**Tasks where patterns exist:**

- ✅ Drafting and writing (follows language patterns)
- ✅ Summarising documents (identifies key information patterns)
- ✅ Formatting and transforming (structure is pure pattern)
- ✅ Brainstorming (seen enormous variety of ideas)
- ✅ Explaining concepts (thousands of explanations in training data)
- ✅ Finding patterns in data (what it's literally built to do)

::: {.notes}
- "AI excels at tasks where there are clear patterns to follow"
- "Writing an email? There are billions of email examples in the training data"
- "Summarising a document? AI has seen thousands of summaries"
- "The key insight: if a task has patterns, AI can probably help"
- "But there's a flip side..."
:::

---

# What AI Is Bad At

**Tasks where patterns aren't enough:**

- ❌ Factual accuracy (generates plausible text, not verified truth)
- ❌ Maths and precise calculations (regularly makes arithmetic errors)
- ❌ Logical reasoning (misses contradictions, gets multi-step logic wrong)
- ❌ Understanding YOUR context (doesn't know your company, team, politics)
- ❌ Ethical judgment (no values, no empathy, no accountability)

::: {.notes}
- "This is the critical part. AI NEVER says 'I don't know'"
- "It will give you a confident, well-structured, completely wrong answer"
- "This is called hallucination — and it's the biggest risk of using AI carelessly"
- "If you only remember one thing from this morning: AI output needs human verification. Always."
- "Let me show you an example of each tool handling the same task differently..."
:::

---

# The "Confident Nonsense" Problem

**AI never says "I don't know."**

Ask a colleague → "I'm not sure, let me check"

Ask AI → Confident, well-structured, completely wrong answer

**This is called hallucination.**

::: {.notes}
- "Hallucination isn't a bug that will be fixed. It's a fundamental property of how these tools work."
- "If the AI hasn't seen enough examples of something, it generates the most plausible-sounding text — which may be entirely fabricated"
- "It will cite academic papers that don't exist. It will invent statistics. It will create fake legal precedents."
- "The rule: verify facts, especially numbers, names, quotes, and references"
- "Now let's look at a framework for deciding when AI can help and when it can't."
:::

---

# Framework 1: AI Task Suitability Spectrum

![](./images/task-suitability-spectrum.png)

::: {.notes}
**The question: "Should I use AI for this?"**

**Four zones:**

- **AI-Led** — Routine, pattern-based tasks. AI does the heavy lifting, you review. Example: formatting notes into meeting minutes.
- **AI-Assisted** — Tasks requiring your judgment, but AI provides substantial help. Example: drafting a client proposal.
- **Human-Led, AI-Supported** — Complex tasks where AI handles sub-parts. Example: strategy document where AI helps with research and formatting.
- **Human-Only** — Tasks requiring empathy, ethics, novel judgment. Example: difficult conversation with a team member.

"The first question to ask with any task: where does it sit on this spectrum?"
"When in doubt, start with more human involvement and delegate to AI as you build trust."
:::

---

# The Four Zones

| Zone | AI Does | You Do |
|------|---------|--------|
| **AI-Led** | Heavy lifting | Review and approve |
| **AI-Assisted** | Substantial help | Guide and verify |
| **Human-Led** | Sub-tasks | Lead the work |
| **Human-Only** | Nothing | Full ownership |

::: {.notes}
- "The key skill is classification — quickly deciding which zone a task belongs in"
- "Most professionals will spend most of their time in the middle two zones"
- "AI-Led tasks are your quick wins — start there"
- "Human-Only tasks are where your value is irreplaceable — protect those"
- "Let's test this with real AI tools..."
:::

---

# Exercise 1: AI Tool Test Drive

![](./images/tool-comparison.png)

**Same task. Three tools. Compare the results.**

::: {.notes}
**What you'll do:**

1. I'm giving you a single workplace task
2. Type the EXACT same prompt into 2-3 different AI tools
3. Compare the outputs: what's different? What's better? What did any tool get wrong?

**The task (display on projector):**

"I manage a team of 8 people in a mid-sized company. One of my team members, who has been a strong performer for 3 years, has been consistently late to work and missing deadlines for the past month. Other team members are starting to notice. Write me a plan for how to address this situation."

- "You have 10 minutes to run the prompt, then 10 minutes to discuss at your table, then we'll debrief"
- "Don't modify the prompt — we want to see how different tools handle the same input"
- "Go."
:::

---

# What Did You Find?

**Three questions:**

1. What surprised you about the differences?
2. Did any tool give bad advice?
3. Which response would you actually use?

::: {.notes}
**Debrief (15 min):**

- Draw out 3-4 observations about differences (tone, structure, content, gaps)
- Spotlight any bad advice or hallucination — this is the highlight
- Connect to the Suitability Spectrum: "This scenario is Human-Led, AI-Supported. The AI helps you think, but the conversation is yours."

**Key message:**
- "There's no objectively 'best' tool. Different tools suit different tasks."
- "What matters is that you try a few, find what works, and NEVER assume the first output is ready to use."

**Bridge to Session 2:**
- "You just saw what happens with a basic prompt. After the break, we'll learn how to dramatically improve what you get back."
:::

---

# The Art of Effective Prompting

![](./images/garbage-in-garbage-out.png)

**The quality of your input determines the quality of your output.**

::: {.notes}
- "This is the most important lesson of the day"
- "Most people type vague prompts and get vague results — then blame the tool"
- "The difference between a lazy prompt and a structured one is the difference between unusable output and output you can actually send"
- "I'm going to show you a framework that makes prompting repeatable"
:::

---

# Framework 2: RTCF Prompt Framework

**Four components of an effective prompt:**

**R** — Role (Who should the AI be?)

**T** — Task (What exactly should it do?)

**C** — Context (What does it need to know?)

**F** — Format (How should the output look?)

::: {.notes}
- "RTCF. Role, Task, Context, Format."
- "Not every prompt needs all four. A simple task might only need Task and Format."
- "But for anything important, all four dramatically improve the result."
- "Let me show you the difference..."
:::

---

# Before and After

**Without RTCF:**
> "Write an email about the project delay"

**With RTCF:**
> **Role:** Senior project manager, professional and empathetic
>
> **Task:** Write a client email explaining a 2-week delivery delay
>
> **Context:** Delay caused by vendor API integration. Client is understanding but values transparency. New delivery date March 15.
>
> **Format:** Under 200 words. Acknowledge → Explain → New date → Recommit.

::: {.notes}
**Do a LIVE DEMO here.**

1. Open an AI tool on the projector
2. Type the "without RTCF" prompt, show the generic result
3. Then type the "with RTCF" prompt, show the dramatically better result
4. Ask the room: "Which email would you actually send?"

- "The first one is generic filler. The second one is close to what you'd actually send."
- "The investment: 60 seconds writing a better prompt. The return: saving 30 minutes of rewriting."
- "Now it's your turn."
:::

---

# RTCF Quick Reference

| Component | Ask Yourself | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Role** | Who should the AI be? | "Senior financial analyst" |
| **Task** | What exactly should it do? | "Create a variance analysis" |
| **Context** | What does it need to know? | "For the CFO, 2-minute summary" |
| **Format** | How should the output look? | "Table: Category, Variance, Explanation" |

::: {.notes}
- "Keep this visible. You'll use it in every exercise for the rest of the day."
- "The most commonly missed components are Context and Format"
- "Role is powerful because it shifts the AI's entire approach — a 'financial analyst' writes differently than a 'marketing copywriter'"
- "Let's practise."
:::

---

# Exercise 2: Prompt Engineering Workshop

![](./images/prompt-workshop.png)

**Three rounds. Same scenarios. Better prompts.**

- **Round 1 (15 min):** Write a natural prompt. See what you get.
- **Round 2 (20 min):** Apply RTCF. Compare the improvement.
- **Round 3 (15 min):** Advanced techniques: chain-of-thought, multiple versions, self-critique

::: {.notes}
- "Pick 3 of the 6 scenarios on your worksheet"
- "Round 1 is deliberately unstructured — write whatever comes naturally"
- "In Round 2, use RTCF. Fill in the table on your worksheet for each prompt."
- "Round 3 is a stretch — try asking the AI to think step-by-step before answering, or to generate multiple versions, or to critique its own work"
- "Start with Round 1 now. You have 15 minutes."
:::

---

# Prompt Engineering: Key Lessons

**What you just experienced:**

1. **Specificity wins** — vague prompts produce generic output
2. **Context is king** — the AI doesn't know what you don't tell it
3. **Format saves time** — specify output structure and paste directly
4. **Iteration beats perfection** — treat first output as a draft

::: {.notes}
**Debrief (10 min):**

- "What was the single biggest improvement from Round 1 to Round 2?"
- "Which RTCF component made the most difference?" (Usually Context or Format)
- "What happened in Round 3? Did chain-of-thought or self-critique improve things further?"

**Key message:**
- "The best prompters don't write one perfect prompt — they write a good prompt, evaluate the output, and refine"
- "Before lunch, save your best prompt to the template library on your worksheet"
:::

# Using AI for Data Work

![](./images/data-analysis-workflow.png)

::: {.notes}
- "This afternoon is about application"
- "First: using AI to analyse data"
- "AI can find patterns in spreadsheets, create visualisations, run analysis, and summarise findings"
- "But — and this is critical — AI makes arithmetic errors, confuses correlation with causation, and sometimes invents data points"
- "You need a process. That's Framework 3."
:::

---

# Framework 3: AI-Assisted Analysis Workflow

**Six steps:**

**Prepare** → Define the question first

**Upload** → Get data into the AI tool

**Question** → Ask progressively deeper questions

**Verify** → Cross-check findings against what you know

**Refine** → Iterate based on results

**Present** → Format for your audience

::: {.notes}
- "The most common mistake: skipping Prepare and jumping straight to Upload"
- "If you don't know what question you're answering, you can't evaluate whether the AI's answer is good"
- "The most important step: Verify. AI is fast but unreliable with numbers."
- "The discipline of checking is what separates useful AI-assisted analysis from dangerous AI-assisted analysis"
:::

---

# The Verification Step

**If a finding would change a decision, verify it manually.**

AI analysis errors to watch for:

- Miscounting rows (especially with filtered data)
- Confusing correlation with causation
- Ignoring missing data without flagging it
- Producing mathematically impossible results
- **Inventing data points that aren't in the source**

::: {.notes}
- "AI finds patterns fast, but humans decide what patterns mean"
- "Spot-check totals and averages. Compare to what you already know."
- "If the AI says something surprising, that's either a genuine insight or a hallucination. Your job is to figure out which."
- "Let's put this workflow into practice with real data..."
:::

---

# Exercise 3: Data Analysis Challenge

![](./images/data-challenge.png)

**260 customer service tickets. 3 business questions. AI-assisted analysis.**

1. What are the top 3 drivers of customer dissatisfaction?
2. Are there patterns in when response times blow out?
3. What would you recommend to the customer service manager?

::: {.notes}
- "You have the RetailFlow customer service dataset — 6 months of ticket data"
- "Upload it to your AI tool and follow the Analysis Workflow on your worksheet"
- "Work individually or in pairs. Start by asking the AI to describe the dataset."
- "You have 25 minutes of working time, then we'll debrief"
- "Remember: Prepare your question, Upload, Question progressively, Verify, Refine, Present"
- "The brief at the end should be something you could hand to a real manager"
:::

---

# What the Data Told Us

**Key patterns you should have found:**

- Returns & Refunds: lowest satisfaction by far
- Delivery Problems: second worst
- Response time is a cross-cutting driver
- Sundays and Mondays: response times blow out
- December: holiday rush, no extra capacity
- Email: 3x slower than Live Chat

::: {.notes}
**Debrief (10 min):**

- "What were the top drivers of dissatisfaction?" [Returns & Refunds, Delivery Problems, response time]
- "When do response times blow out?" [Sundays, Mondays, December, Email channel]
- "Did anyone catch the AI getting something wrong?" [THIS IS THE KEY QUESTION]
- If someone caught an error: spend time on it. This is the verification lesson.
- If nobody verified: "If you didn't verify, you don't actually know if those findings are correct."

**Key message:**
- "You just did in 25 minutes what would have taken hours manually. That's the promise. But the quality depends on Step 4 — Verify."
:::

---

# AI Beyond Chat

![](./images/ai-landscape.png)

**AI is moving from "a tool you go to" to "a capability in every tool you use."**

- Microsoft 365 Copilot — in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook
- Google Workspace AI — in Docs, Sheets, Gmail
- Automation platforms — Zapier, Make, Power Automate
- Specialist tools — Grammarly, Otter.ai, Beautiful.ai

::: {.notes}
- "Chat interfaces like ChatGPT and Claude are the most visible AI tools"
- "But AI is increasingly embedded in the software you already use"
- "Within a few years, using AI won't feel like a separate activity — it'll just be how software works"
- "The question isn't whether you'll use AI — it's whether you'll use it well"
- "Framework 4 helps you figure out where to start."
:::

---

# Framework 4: AI Opportunity Finder

**Four types of AI opportunity in your daily work:**

| Type | The Signal | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Automate** | High-volume, repetitive, no judgment | Formatting reports, sorting emails |
| **Assist** | Research, synthesis, gathering | Summarising documents, comparing proposals |
| **Generate** | Writing, drafting, content creation | Client emails, meeting agendas, job postings |
| **Analyse** | Data, patterns, trends | Monthly performance, customer feedback |

::: {.notes}
- "Not every part of your job benefits from AI. The skill is knowing WHERE it adds value."
- "Start with Automate — those are your Quick Wins. Low effort, high time saved."
- "Assist and Generate are where most professionals will spend the most time with AI."
- "Analyse is what you practised in Exercise 3."
- "Some tasks are Human-Only: empathy, ethics, relationships, novel judgment. Keep those."
:::

---

# Start with Quick Wins

![](./images/priority-matrix.png)

```
                HIGH time saved
                     |
     Quick Wins      |     Big Wins
   (do these first)  |   (plan for these)
                     |
LOW effort ——————————+———————————— HIGH effort
                     |
   Low Priority      |     Worth It Later
                     |
                LOW time saved
```

::: {.notes}
- "Start in the top-left. Quick Wins build confidence and momentum."
- "Don't try to automate your entire job on day one"
- "Pick the task you do most frequently that bores you the most. That's your first candidate."
- "Now let's apply this to YOUR work..."
:::

# Exercise 4: Your AI-Enhanced Workflow

![](./images/workflow-redesign.png)

**Your real work. Your real workflow. Redesigned with AI.**

1. **Map** your current workflow (10 min)
2. **Redesign** with AI at each applicable step (15 min)
3. **Test** one step live (10 min)
4. **Share** your before/after with your table (5 min)

::: {.notes}
- "Everything today has used our scenarios and our data. This exercise is about YOU."
- "Pick one task you do at least weekly that takes 30+ minutes"
- "Map every step: what you do, what tool you use, how long it takes"
- "Then classify each step using the Opportunity Finder: Automate, Assist, Generate, Analyse, or Human-Only"
- "Redesign the workflow. Then test one step for real."
- "Take 2 minutes to choose your task. If you're stuck, I have suggestions."
:::

# What You Built Today

![](./images/four-frameworks.png)

**Four frameworks. Four skills.**

1. **AI Task Suitability Spectrum** → Know WHEN to use AI
2. **RTCF Prompt Framework** → Know HOW to talk to AI
3. **AI-Assisted Analysis Workflow** → Know how to use AI with DATA
4. **AI Opportunity Finder** → Know WHERE AI fits in your work

::: {.notes}
- "Step back and look at what you've built today"
- "You now have four tools that work together:"
- "Encounter a task → check the Spectrum → if AI is involved, write a prompt using RTCF → if there's data, follow the Analysis Workflow → once a week, use the Opportunity Finder to spot new tasks to try"
- "The key principle across all four: AI is a tool, not a colleague. You own the output and the decisions."
:::

---

# Key Principles

- **AI is a tool, not a colleague** — you own the output
- **Better input = better output** — invest in your prompts
- **Verify before you trust** — especially facts and numbers
- **Start small, build confidence** — quick wins first
- **Iterate, don't accept** — first drafts are starting points

::: {.notes}
- "If you remember five things from today, remember these"
- "AI is a tool. A powerful tool, but a tool. You are responsible for what it produces."
- "The 60 seconds you spend writing a good prompt saves 30 minutes of rewriting"
- "Never send AI output without reviewing it. Your name is on it, not ChatGPT's."
- "Start with one task this week. Not five. One. Build from there."
- "The best results come from iteration. First draft → feedback → refinement."
:::

---

# Your Action Plan

![](./images/action-plan.png)

**This Week:**
What is the ONE AI tool or technique you'll try?

**This Month:**
What workflow will you redesign with AI?

**This Quarter:**
What AI skill will you develop further?

::: {.notes}
- "Take out your Personal Action Plan template"
- "This is the most important part of the day — making it concrete"
- "Don't write 'use AI more.' Write: 'I will use Claude to draft my weekly status update on Thursday using RTCF.'"
- "Specific task. Specific tool. Specific day."
- Give 10 minutes of quiet time. Don't talk over this.
- Ask 2-3 volunteers to share their "this week" commitment
:::
