# Practical AI for Professionals

**One-Day Executive Education Workshop | Curtin Business School**

---

## Overview

A hands-on, bring-your-own-device workshop that builds practical AI skills for immediate workplace use. Participants learn to prompt AI tools effectively, analyse data with AI assistance, and identify where AI fits in their daily work. They leave with frameworks, templates, and a personal action plan, not theory.

**Duration:** 1 day (9:00 AM – 4:30 PM)

**Audience:** Professionals across all functions and industries

**Prerequisites:** None — just a laptop and curiosity

**Class size:** 15–30 participants (table groups of 4–6)

## Series Context

This is Course 1 of three. Each course stands alone, but together they cover the full AI capability lifecycle.

| Course | Question It Answers | Who It's For |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| **1. AI for Professionals** | How do I use AI effectively? | All professionals |
| **2. AI-Driven Business Innovation** | Which AI project should we fund? | Executives, strategists |
| **3. AI Leadership & PM** | How do I deliver this AI project? | Project managers, team leads |

Course 1 builds the foundational literacy that Courses 2 and 3 assume.

## What Participants Learn

**Session 1 — AI Foundations:** What AI tools actually do (and don't do). How to assess whether a task is suitable for AI. Hands-on comparison of ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

**Session 2 — Prompt Engineering:** A repeatable framework for getting useful output from AI. Three rounds of progressive skill-building across real workplace scenarios — drafting emails, summarising documents, writing reports.

**Session 3 — Data Analysis:** How to use AI to find patterns in data and produce business insights. Participants analyse a customer service dataset and produce a one-page brief — with emphasis on verifying AI output.

**Session 4 — Your Workflow:** Participants pick a real task from their own job, map it, and redesign it with AI at the steps where it adds value. They test at least one step live.
