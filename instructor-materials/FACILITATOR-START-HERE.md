## What You're Teaching

This is a **hands-on skills workshop**, not a strategic masterclass. The other two courses in the series teach executives where to invest in AI and how to manage AI projects. This course teaches professionals how to actually use AI tools in their daily work.

### The Four Exercises Build on Each Other

| Exercise | What Participants Learn | The "Aha!" Moment |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **1. AI Tool Test Drive** | AI tools are different from each other — and none are perfect | "These tools give different answers to the same question" |
| **2. Prompt Engineering** | The quality of your input determines the quality of your output | "I got dramatically better results just by being more specific" |
| **3. Data Analysis** | AI can accelerate analysis but needs human verification | "The AI found something real — but it also got things wrong" |
| **4. Workflow Mapping** | AI fits into specific parts of real work, not all of it | "I can actually see where this saves me time in my job" |

**The arc of the day:** Orientation → Skill-building → Application → Personalisation

By 4:30 PM, every participant should be able to articulate: *"Here's what I'll use AI for, here's how I'll prompt it, and here's where I'll keep a human in the loop."*

## Facilitation Philosophy

### This Is a Workshop, Not a Lecture

Your lecture segments total about 2 hours across the day. The other 5+ hours are exercises, discussion, and hands-on practice. Resist the urge to extend lecture time.

### Core Principles

**1. Let them experience it first, then explain why.**
Don't teach RTCF as theory — have them write bad prompts first (Round 1), feel the pain, then introduce the framework (Round 2). The contrast teaches better than any slide.

**2. Mistakes are the curriculum.**
When someone's AI hallucinates or gives a terrible answer, that's not a failure — it's the best teaching moment of the day. Celebrate it. "This is exactly what we need to see."

**3. Meet them where they are.**
The room will have people who've used ChatGPT daily for a year alongside people who've never opened it. Your job is to make both groups feel challenged. Use stretch challenges for advanced participants and pair beginners with more experienced users.

**4. Make it about their real work.**
Every exercise connects to real tasks from their jobs. Exercise 4 is explicitly about their own workflow. Keep pulling the thread: "How would you use this at your desk on Monday?"

**5. You don't need to be an AI expert.**
You need to be a good facilitator who understands the frameworks. If an AI tool does something unexpected, use it: "Interesting — why do we think it did that?" You're modelling good AI practice by not pretending to have all the answers.

## Full Day Timeline

### Session 1: AI Foundations & Orientation (9:00-10:30)

| Time | Duration | Activity | Your Role |
|------|----------|----------|-----------|
| 9:00 | 15 min | **Welcome & Introductions** | Facilitate introductions, set expectations |
| 9:15 | 35 min | **Lecture: What AI Actually Is** | Present Framework 1: AI Task Suitability Spectrum |
| 9:50 | 40 min | **Exercise 1: AI Tool Test Drive** | Circulate, observe, facilitate debrief |

**Key teaching points for the lecture:**
- AI predicts the next word — it's pattern-matching, not thinking
- Different tools, different strengths (no single "best" tool)
- The AI Task Suitability Spectrum: AI-Led → AI-Assisted → Human-Led → Human-Only
- Hallucination is real and dangerous — AI never says "I don't know"

**Transition to Exercise 1:** "You've heard me talk about what AI can and can't do. Now let's test that. You're about to give three different AI tools the exact same task and see what happens."

### Morning Tea (10:30-11:00)

**During the break:**
- Check in with anyone who had tech issues during Exercise 1
- Note who seems advanced and who seems brand-new — adjust pairings for Exercise 2 if needed
- Reset projector for Session 2

### Session 2: Prompt & Context Engineering (11:00-12:30)

| Time | Duration | Activity | Your Role |
|------|----------|----------|-----------|
| 11:00 | 30 min | **Lecture: The Art of Effective Prompting** | Present Framework 2: RTCF Prompt Framework |
| 11:30 | 60 min | **Exercise 2: Prompt Engineering Workshop** | Circulate, compare outputs, facilitate debrief |

**Key teaching points for the lecture:**
- "Garbage in, garbage out" applies to AI more than anything
- RTCF: Role, Task, Context, Format — a repeatable structure
- Show a live before/after demo: write a bad prompt, get bad output, rewrite with RTCF, get good output
- Common mistakes: too vague, no context, no format, not iterating
- Context windows: what they are, why they matter

**Live demo suggestion:** Pick Scenario 3 (project status update) from the worksheet. Show a naive prompt and the output, then rewrite it with RTCF live in front of the room. The contrast is immediate and convincing.

**Transition to Exercise 2:** "I just showed you the difference RTCF makes. Now it's your turn. You have 6 workplace scenarios — pick 3 and experience the difference yourself."

→ Open `exercise-2-facilitator-guide.md`

### Lunch & Networking (12:30-1:15)

**During lunch:**
- Leave the projector showing the RTCF framework as a reminder
- Be available for questions but don't work through lunch yourself
- Mentally prepare for Session 3 — the energy dip after lunch is real

### Session 3: AI-Powered Data Analysis (1:15-2:30)

| Time | Duration | Activity | Your Role |
|------|----------|----------|-----------|
| 1:15 | 30 min | **Lecture: Using AI for Data Work** | Present Framework 3: AI-Assisted Analysis Workflow |
| 1:45 | 45 min | **Exercise 3: Data Analysis Challenge** | Circulate, check for errors, facilitate debrief |

**Key teaching points for the lecture:**
- Define the question BEFORE you touch the tool (Prepare step)
- Progressive questioning: start broad, go deeper
- Verification is non-negotiable — AI makes arithmetic and logic errors with data
- Privacy: what data should never go into free AI tools
- The 6-step workflow: Prepare → Upload → Question → Verify → Refine → Present

**Energy management:** This is the post-lunch slot. The data analysis exercise is interactive and hands-on, which helps. Keep your lecture tight (30 min max) and get them working with data quickly.

**Transition to Exercise 3:** "You now have a framework for prompting and a workflow for analysis. Let's put both together. You're about to receive 6 months of real customer service data from RetailFlow and three business questions that need answers."

→ Open `exercise-3-facilitator-guide.md`

### Afternoon Tea (2:30-3:00)

**During the break:**
- Note interesting findings from Exercise 3 to reference in Session 4
- Prepare for Exercise 4 — this is the most personal exercise and some participants may need encouragement choosing a task

### Session 4: AI in Your Workflow (3:00-4:00)

| Time | Duration | Activity | Your Role |
|------|----------|----------|-----------|
| 3:00 | 20 min | **Lecture: Low-Code AI Integration** | Present Framework 4: AI Opportunity Finder |
| 3:20 | 40 min | **Exercise 4: Your AI-Enhanced Workflow** | Circulate, help with task selection, facilitate sharing |

**Key teaching points for the lecture:**
- AI is moving from "a tool you go to" to "a capability in every tool"
- Four opportunity types: Automate, Assist, Generate, Analyse
- Start with Quick Wins: low effort, high time saved
- Responsible use: company policies, human oversight, data governance
- Brief overview of platforms: Copilot, Zapier, Make, Power Automate (awareness, not training)

**Transition to Exercise 4:** "Everything today has used our scenarios and our data. This last exercise is about YOUR work. Pick one real task from your week and redesign it with what you've learned today."

→ Open `exercise-4-facilitator-guide.md`

### Wrap-up & Action Planning (4:00-4:30)

| Time | Duration | Activity | Your Role |
|------|----------|----------|-----------|
| 4:00 | 15 min | **Framework Synthesis** | Recap all 4 frameworks, key principles |
| 4:15 | 15 min | **Personal Action Planning** | Guide them through the action plan template |

**Framework synthesis — your script:**

> "Let's step back and look at what you've built today. You now have four tools:
>
> 1. The **Suitability Spectrum** tells you WHEN to use AI — not every task needs it, and some tasks should stay human-only.
>
> 2. **RTCF** tells you HOW to talk to AI — Role, Task, Context, Format. You experienced the difference between a lazy prompt and a structured one.
>
> 3. The **Analysis Workflow** tells you how to use AI WITH DATA — and why verification is non-negotiable. Some of you caught the AI making errors today. That's the skill.
>
> 4. The **Opportunity Finder** tells you WHERE ELSE in your work AI can help — and you've already mapped one real workflow.
>
> The key principle across all four: **AI is a tool, not a colleague. You own the output and the decisions.**"

**Action planning:**
- Distribute the Personal Action Plan template
- Give them 10 minutes of quiet time to fill it in — don't talk over this
- Ask 2-3 volunteers to share their "this week" commitment
- End with course feedback form and next-in-series pointers

**Closing script:**

> "You're not going to be an AI expert tomorrow. But you have something better — a framework for getting started and a realistic sense of what these tools can and can't do. Start small. Pick one thing. Try it this week. Build from there."

## Common Situations & How to Handle Them

### "I've already been using ChatGPT for months — this is too basic"

**Your move:** Acknowledge their experience and make them a resource.

> "That's great — you'll get through the basics quickly. I'd love you to help others at your table who are newer to this. And in each exercise, there are stretch challenges designed for exactly your level."

In Exercise 2, ask them to try the advanced techniques. In Exercise 3, ask them to find patterns beyond the three questions. In Exercise 4, ask them to tackle a more complex workflow.

### "I've never used any AI tool before — I'm lost"

**Your move:** Normalise it and pair them.

> "That's exactly who this workshop is for. Let's make sure you're set up, and I'll pair you with someone at your table who can help with the mechanics while you focus on learning."

Check their account access during Exercise 1. If they're stuck on setup, troubleshoot quickly — don't let tech issues eat into their learning time.

### "AI just gave me completely wrong information"

**Your move:** Celebrate it.

> "Perfect — this is exactly what we need to see. Can you show the group? This is hallucination in action. The AI sounds confident but it's wrong. This is why verification matters."

Use it as a live teaching moment. Ask the group: "How would you know this was wrong if you didn't already know the answer?"

### "Isn't AI going to take our jobs?"

**Your move:** Address it honestly without dismissing the concern.

> "It's a fair question. Here's what we're seeing: AI is changing jobs, not eliminating most of them. The tasks that are routine and pattern-based — yes, AI will handle more of those. But the judgment, creativity, relationships, and ethical decisions? Those stay human. Today is about making sure you're the professional who knows how to work WITH AI, not the one who gets surprised by it."

### "My company doesn't allow us to use ChatGPT"

**Your move:** Validate the policy and redirect.

> "That's actually responsible of your organisation. Data privacy is serious, and we'll talk about that today. For now, you can use the tools here for the workshop exercises — we're using practice scenarios, not real company data. Take notes on the techniques, and when you're back at work, check with your IT team about which tools are approved."

### "The wifi is down / AI tool isn't loading"

**Your move:** Pair up.

> "Share with your neighbour for now — one person drives, the other navigates. Some of the best learning happens when two people discuss what to prompt."

If venue wifi is unreliable, have a mobile hotspot as backup. See Troubleshooting Tech section below.

### The room is split — some are way ahead, others are struggling

**Your move:** Use table-level differentiation.

Seat experienced users with beginners (if you can control seating). Give advanced participants explicit stretch challenges. Check in with struggling participants individually during exercises — don't call them out publicly.

## Troubleshooting Tech

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Participant can't log into AI tool | Have them try a different tool (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT — any one will work) |
| Corporate firewall blocks AI tools | Try mobile data on their phone as a workaround; pair with neighbour if needed |
| Wifi is slow | Reduce the number of tools in Exercise 1 from 3 to 2; stagger uploads in Exercise 3 |
| AI tool is down (outage) | Switch everyone to a working tool; have backup screenshots of example outputs |
| CSV won't upload | Copy/paste the first 50 rows instead; it's enough to find the patterns |
| Projector fails | Use your laptop screen and walk the room; adjust to more hands-on, less presentation |

**Pre-test everything the day before.** Open ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini from the venue network. Upload a test CSV. If anything is blocked, you need to know before participants arrive.

## Success Looks Like

By end of day, you should observe:

- [ ] Participants writing structured prompts without being reminded (RTCF is internalised)
- [ ] At least one "the AI got it wrong!" moment that the group learned from
- [ ] Participants talking about their real work, not just the exercises
- [ ] Multiple people saying some version of "I'm going to try this on Monday"
- [ ] The action plans have specific, concrete commitments — not vague intentions
- [ ] The room energy stays engaged through the afternoon (Exercise 3 and 4 keep energy up)

## Key Differences from the Other Courses in the Series

| | This Course | Business Innovation | Leadership & PM |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Facilitator style** | Coach / workshop leader | Strategic facilitator | Simulation director |
| **Main activity type** | Hands-on practice with AI tools | Group frameworks + role-play | Crisis simulation + decision-making |
| **Level of ambiguity** | Low — clear tasks, clear outputs | Medium — strategic judgment needed | High — no right answers |
| **Participant emotion** | Curiosity, some anxiety | Confidence, strategic thinking | Pressure, intensity |
| **Your biggest risk** | Tech issues, wide skill gap | Groups defaulting to safe choices | Groups rushing through crises |

**Your biggest facilitation challenge:** Managing the skill gap. Some participants will fly through exercises while others are still setting up accounts. Plan for this. Have stretch challenges ready. Use experienced participants as peer mentors.

---

**You're ready. Read the exercise guides, print the materials, test the tech, and trust the design. The exercises do the teaching — you guide the conversation.**
