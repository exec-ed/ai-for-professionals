# Exercise 4: Your AI-Enhanced Workflow — Facilitator Guide

**Duration:** 40 minutes (3:20-4:00 PM)
**Frameworks used:** AI Opportunity Finder, RTCF Prompt Framework, AI Task Suitability Spectrum
**Core learning:** AI fits into specific parts of real work — the skill is knowing which parts to delegate and which to keep.

---

## Pre-Exercise Setup

**Materials needed:**
- Workflow Mapping Template (1 per participant, printed)
- Frameworks Reference Sheet (already distributed — they'll use the Opportunity Finder)

**No technology setup needed** — participants use whatever AI tool they prefer from earlier exercises.

---

## Why This Exercise Matters

This is the exercise that makes the day personal. Exercises 1-3 used supplied scenarios and data. Exercise 4 uses the participant's own job. This is where they go from "I understand how AI works" to "I know what I'll do with it."

It's also the exercise where some participants freeze. Choosing a real task and redesigning it feels higher-stakes than working through a practice scenario. Be ready to help with task selection.

## The Exercise

### Setup (5 min) — 3:15 PM

Distribute the Workflow Mapping Template (if not already distributed).

**Your script:**

> "Everything today has used our scenarios and our data. This exercise is about you.
>
> Here's what you're going to do: pick one task you do at least weekly that takes 30 minutes or more. Something you find repetitive or time-consuming. Then you'll map out how you do it today — every step. And then you'll redesign that workflow with AI at the steps where it adds value.
>
> This isn't theoretical. By the end, you should have a before-and-after diagram of a real task from your real job — and you'll have tested at least one step live.
>
> Take 2 minutes right now to choose your task. If you're stuck, I have suggestions."

### Helping with Task Selection

**This is where participants get stuck most.** Have these prompts ready:

**If someone says "I don't know what to pick":**

> "Think about your last week. What task made you think 'I wish I didn't have to do this again'? Or what took longer than it should have?"

**If someone picks something too simple** (e.g., "sending an email"):

> "That's a good start, but let's find something with more steps. What about the whole process around that email? What do you do before writing it and after sending it?"

**If someone picks something too complex** (e.g., "our entire quarterly planning process"):

> "That's a great long-term project. For today, let's zoom into one piece of it — maybe the part where you gather data, or the part where you write the summary. Which piece is most repetitive?"

**Common good choices:**
- Writing a weekly status report / team update
- Preparing meeting agendas or minutes
- Creating monthly reports from raw data
- Onboarding documentation for new hires
- Compiling information from multiple sources for a briefing
- Processing and responding to a batch of similar requests
- Preparing a slide deck from meeting notes

### Part 1: Map (10 min) — 3:20 PM

**Your script:**

> "Map your current workflow. Write every step in the table on your worksheet — what you do, what tool you use, and roughly how long each step takes. Be honest and specific. Include the boring parts — the copying, the formatting, the switching between systems."

**Your role:** Circulate and check that:
- Tasks are specific enough (not "do my job" but "create the weekly client report")
- Steps are granular (not "write the report" but "pull data from CRM, open template, copy numbers into table, write commentary, format, email to team")
- Time estimates are reasonable

**Common prompt:** "Is there a step you're forgetting? What about the setup at the beginning or the follow-up at the end?"

---

### Part 2: Redesign (15 min) — 3:30 PM

**Your script:**

> "Now go through each step and classify it using the AI Opportunity Finder on your reference sheet. Is this step something to Automate, Assist, Generate, Analyse, or is it Human-Only?
>
> Then redesign the workflow. For each step where AI helps, note what tool you'd use and what you'd ask it to do. Use RTCF if you're writing a prompt.
>
> Be realistic. Not every step needs AI. Some steps are Human-Only and should stay that way."

**Your role:** This is the most coaching-intensive part of the day.

**What to watch for:**

| Behaviour | Your Move |
|-----------|-----------|
| Participant marks everything as "AI-Led" | "Really? Every step? Which steps require your judgment or your relationships? Those should stay human." |
| Participant marks everything as "Human-Only" | "Let's look at step 3 — you said you copy data from one system to another. Could AI help with that?" |
| Participant is designing a complex automation | "For today, focus on what you could do with ChatGPT or Claude — not a full automation platform. Save Zapier for later." |
| Participant is stuck on redesign | "Don't redesign the whole thing. Pick the ONE step that's most tedious and start there." |
| Participant has a great before/after | "This is strong. Would you be willing to share a 2-minute version in Part 4?" |

**Key coaching move:** Check that every redesigned workflow has at least one human review/verification step. If someone has AI generating a client email with no human review before it sends, flag it: "What happens if the AI gets the tone wrong?"

---

### Part 3: Test (10 min) — 3:45 PM

**Your script:**

> "Pick one step — the most promising AI-assisted step in your new workflow. Try it right now, for real. Write the prompt using RTCF, run it, and see what you get. You have 10 minutes."

**Your role:** Move quickly between tables. Help with prompt-writing if needed, but mostly observe.

**What you're looking for:**
- Participants are applying RTCF without being reminded (it's internalised)
- The output is relevant to their actual work (not generic)
- Participants are evaluating the output critically (not just accepting it)

**If someone gets a great result:** "Would this have taken you less time than doing it manually? How much less?"

**If someone gets a poor result:** "What's missing from the output? Can you improve the prompt? This is exactly the iteration skill from Exercise 2."

---

### Part 4: Share (5 min) — 3:55 PM

**Your script:**

> "Quick round — 2 minutes each. Tell your table:
> 1. What's the task?
> 2. Which step did you redesign with AI?
> 3. What happened when you tested it?
> 4. What will you try at work this week?
>
> One person per table, volunteer — go."

**Your role:** Listen for strong examples you can reference in the wrap-up. If time permits and there's a particularly compelling before/after, ask that person to share with the whole room (30 seconds).

**Don't** force everyone to present. Volunteers only. The lightning format keeps energy up.

## Common Facilitation Moves

| Situation | Your Move |
|-----------|-----------|
| Someone can't think of a task | Suggest: "What's the most boring thing on your calendar this week?" |
| Someone's workflow has 15 steps | "That's thorough! For the template, group some steps together. Focus on the 6-8 main stages." |
| Someone says "AI can't help with my job" | "What about the preparation around your job? Meeting prep, notes, follow-ups, reports?" |
| Someone is designing the perfect system instead of testing | "Stop designing, start testing. Pick one step and try it NOW." |
| The room is low energy (it's late afternoon) | Keep it moving. The sharing part creates energy. "Who had a surprising result?" |
| Someone tested and got a terrible result | "Great data point. What would you change? That's the iteration cycle." |

## Bridge to Wrap-up

**Your script:**

> "You now have something none of the exercises before this gave you — a plan for YOUR work. Not a practice scenario. YOUR weekly task, YOUR workflow, YOUR AI-enhanced redesign.
>
> In the wrap-up, you'll turn this into a commitment. What will you actually try this week? Let's lock that in."
