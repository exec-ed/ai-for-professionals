# AI for the Rest of Us: A Practical Introduction

## Summary

AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are now freely available to anyone with a browser. They can draft emails, summarise documents, analyse data, write code, and brainstorm ideas — but they also hallucinate facts, miss nuance, and confidently deliver nonsense. This pre-reading gives you the conceptual foundation you need before the workshop: how these tools actually work (pattern-matching, not thinking), what they're reliably good at, where they fall apart, and how to stay safe with company data. The goal isn't to make you an expert — it's to get you comfortable enough that the workshop can focus on building real skills, not explaining basics.

**Reading time:** 20 minutes
**Key takeaway:** AI tools are powerful pattern-matching assistants, not intelligent colleagues — the better you understand what's actually happening, the better results you'll get.

## Who This Is For

This is not a reading for executives making investment decisions or project managers leading AI initiatives. This is for **you** — a professional who wants to use AI tools effectively in your daily work.

You might be:
- A marketing coordinator who's heard ChatGPT can draft copy
- A finance analyst wondering if AI can help with spreadsheets
- An HR manager curious about using AI for policy documents
- An operations lead who wants to automate repetitive reporting
- A professional in any field who feels like everyone else "gets" AI and you're behind

**You're not behind.** Most people are still figuring this out. That's what the workshop is for.

## Part 1: What Are AI Tools, Actually?

### The Tools You'll Encounter

When people say "AI" today, they usually mean one of these:

| Tool | Made By | What It Is |
|------|---------|------------|
| ChatGPT | OpenAI | Conversational AI — chat, write, analyse, code |
| Claude | Anthropic | Conversational AI — similar to ChatGPT, different strengths |
| Gemini | Google | Conversational AI — integrated with Google Workspace |
| Microsoft Copilot | Microsoft | AI embedded in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook |
| Notion AI | Notion | AI built into the Notion workspace |
| Grammarly | Grammarly | AI writing assistant |

These are all built on the same underlying technology: **large language models (LLMs)**.

### How They Actually Work

Here's the most important thing to understand about AI tools:

**They predict the next word.**

That's it. When you type "Write me an email to a client about...", the AI doesn't *understand* your request the way a colleague would. It predicts what words are most likely to come next, based on patterns it learned from billions of pages of text during training.

Think of it as **autocomplete on steroids:**
- Your phone's autocomplete predicts one word at a time
- AI tools predict thousands of words at a time
- The result often *looks* like understanding — but it's pattern-matching

**Why this matters to you:**
- AI is incredibly good at tasks where patterns exist (writing styles, document formats, data structures)
- AI is unreliable at tasks requiring genuine understanding (novel reasoning, factual accuracy, nuanced judgment)
- Your job is to know the difference

### The "Confident Nonsense" Problem

AI tools have a distinctive failure mode: **they never say "I don't know."**

Ask a colleague a question they can't answer, and they'll say "I'm not sure, let me check." Ask an AI the same question, and it will give you a confident, well-structured, completely wrong answer.

This is called **hallucination** — the AI generates plausible-sounding content that is factually incorrect.

**Examples of hallucination:**
- Citing academic papers that don't exist
- Inventing statistics with specific numbers
- Making up features of real products
- Creating fake but realistic-looking legal precedents

**The rule:** AI output needs human verification. Always. Especially for facts, numbers, quotes, and references.

## Part 2: What AI Tools Are Good At

### Reliable Strengths

These are tasks where AI tools consistently perform well:

**1. Drafting and Writing**
- First drafts of emails, reports, proposals
- Rewriting text for different audiences (formal → casual, technical → plain language)
- Expanding bullet points into paragraphs
- Condensing long documents into summaries

**Why it works well:** Writing follows patterns (grammar, structure, tone) that AI has seen billions of examples of.

**2. Summarising and Extracting**
- Condensing a 20-page report to key points
- Pulling specific information from long documents
- Creating meeting summaries from notes
- Extracting data from unstructured text

**Why it works well:** The information is already there — AI just needs to identify what's important based on your instructions.

**3. Brainstorming and Ideation**
- Generating options you haven't considered
- Exploring a problem from different angles
- Creating lists of possibilities
- Playing devil's advocate on your ideas

**Why it works well:** AI has seen enormous variety in how people approach problems, so it can suggest angles you might not think of.

**4. Formatting and Transforming**
- Converting data between formats (CSV to table, list to paragraph)
- Restructuring documents
- Creating consistent formatting across materials
- Generating templates from examples

**Why it works well:** Format conversion is pure pattern-matching — exactly what AI excels at.

**5. Explaining and Teaching**
- Breaking down complex concepts into simple language
- Explaining technical topics to non-technical audiences
- Creating step-by-step instructions
- Answering "how does X work?" questions

**Why it works well:** The AI has seen thousands of explanations of most topics and can adapt the level to your needs.

**6. Data Analysis (with the right approach)**
- Finding patterns in spreadsheets
- Creating charts and visualisations
- Running basic statistical analysis
- Answering questions about datasets

**Why it works well:** Data analysis follows well-defined procedures that AI can execute — but results need human interpretation.

## Part 3: Where AI Tools Fall Apart

### Known Weaknesses

These are tasks where AI tools regularly fail or produce unreliable results:

**1. Factual Accuracy**
- AI does not "know" facts the way you do
- It generates text that *sounds* factual based on patterns
- Specific numbers, dates, names, and citations are frequently wrong
- Recent events may be unknown (training data has a cutoff date)

**The fix:** Always verify facts, especially numbers and references. Use AI for structure and drafting, not as a source of truth.

**2. Maths and Precise Calculations**
- AI makes arithmetic errors regularly
- Complex calculations are unreliable
- It may round, estimate, or hallucinate numbers
- Spreadsheet formulas it writes may contain errors

**The fix:** Use AI to write formulas or set up analysis, then verify the results. Don't trust AI-generated numbers without checking.

**3. Logical Reasoning**
- Multi-step logic problems trip AI up
- It can miss obvious contradictions
- Complex "if-then" chains become unreliable
- It may agree with you even when you're wrong

**The fix:** For complex reasoning, break the problem into small steps and verify each one. Don't rely on AI for critical logical deductions.

**4. Understanding Your Specific Context**
- AI doesn't know your company, your team, your industry norms
- It gives generic advice unless you provide specific context
- It can't read the room or understand office politics
- It doesn't know what happened in yesterday's meeting

**The fix:** Provide context explicitly. The more specific information you give, the more relevant the output. This is what prompt engineering is about — and it's the core of the workshop.

**5. Consistency Across Long Conversations**
- AI can contradict itself in long conversations
- It may "forget" instructions from earlier in the chat
- Style and tone can drift over time
- Complex multi-part tasks may lose coherence

**The fix:** For important work, start fresh conversations. Restate key requirements. Don't assume the AI "remembers" what you discussed 20 messages ago.

## Part 4: The AI Landscape Beyond Chatbots

### AI Is Bigger Than Chat

Chatbots are the most visible AI tools, but AI is increasingly embedded in software you already use:

**AI in Productivity Software:**
- Microsoft Copilot in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook
- Google Workspace AI in Docs, Sheets, Gmail
- Notion AI for notes and documentation
- Canva AI for design

**AI in Specialist Tools:**
- Grammarly (writing quality)
- Otter.ai (meeting transcription)
- Beautiful.ai (presentation design)
- Tableau AI (data visualisation)

**AI in Automation Platforms:**
- Zapier (connecting apps with AI steps)
- Make (workflow automation)
- Power Automate (Microsoft ecosystem automation)

**The trend:** AI is moving from "a separate tool you go to" to "a capability built into every tool you already use." Within a few years, using AI won't feel like a separate activity — it'll just be how software works.

### Types of AI Assistance

Not all AI assistance is the same. Understanding the spectrum helps you set expectations:

| Type | What It Does | Example | Your Role |
|------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| **Autocomplete** | Finishes what you started | Gmail Smart Compose | Accept/reject suggestions |
| **Co-pilot** | Works alongside you in real-time | GitHub Copilot, Excel Copilot | Guide and review |
| **Chat assistant** | Responds to requests conversationally | ChatGPT, Claude | Ask, review, iterate |
| **Automation** | Executes multi-step workflows | Zapier AI, Power Automate | Set up, monitor, handle exceptions |
| **Agent** | Completes goals autonomously | AI research agents | Define goal, review output |

In the workshop, we'll focus primarily on **chat assistant** and **co-pilot** interactions, as these give you the most control and learning.

## Part 5: Staying Safe — Privacy, Security, and Common Sense

### What Happens to Your Data?

When you type something into an AI tool, you should assume:

- **Free tiers:** Your input may be used to train future models. Don't enter sensitive data.
- **Paid tiers:** Most providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) have "no training" policies for paid accounts — but read the terms.
- **Enterprise tiers:** Typically the strongest data protection guarantees.

### The Golden Rules

**1. Never enter confidential or sensitive information into free AI tools**
- Customer personal data
- Financial information
- Proprietary business data
- Passwords, API keys, credentials
- Employee personal information

**2. Check your company's AI policy**
- Many organisations now have AI usage policies
- Some restrict which tools can be used
- Some require enterprise accounts for work data
- If your company doesn't have a policy yet, ask about it

**3. Never publish AI output without review**
- AI-generated content can contain errors, bias, or plagiarism
- You are responsible for anything you send, publish, or submit — even if AI wrote it
- "The AI wrote it" is not a defence

**4. Be transparent about AI use**
- If your organisation or client expects original work, disclose AI assistance
- Academic and professional contexts increasingly require AI disclosure
- When in doubt, mention it

### Copyright and Ownership

This area is evolving rapidly, but the current state:

- **Your prompts:** You own what you write
- **AI output:** Copyright status is legally unclear in most jurisdictions
- **Training data:** AI may reproduce patterns from copyrighted material
- **Practical advice:** Treat AI output as a starting point that you modify and make your own. The more you edit and add your expertise, the more clearly it's your work.

---

## Part 6: The Right Mindset

### AI Is a Tool, Not a Colleague

The most productive way to think about AI tools:

**Think of AI as a very fast, very well-read intern:**
- Eager to help
- Can produce decent first drafts quickly
- Needs clear instructions
- Makes mistakes if not supervised
- Gets better with specific feedback
- Doesn't understand what it doesn't understand

**Don't think of AI as:**
- A replacement for your expertise
- A source of truth
- An infallible calculator
- A colleague who understands context
- A system you can set and forget

### The Human-AI Sweet Spot

The best results come from combining AI speed with human judgment:

| AI Does | You Do |
|---------|--------|
| Generate first draft | Edit, refine, add expertise |
| Find patterns in data | Interpret what patterns mean |
| Suggest options | Choose the right option |
| Format and structure | Verify accuracy and relevance |
| Work fast | Think deep |

**The professionals who get the most from AI aren't the ones who ask it to do everything — they're the ones who know exactly which parts to delegate and which to keep.**

### It's OK to Be Skeptical

Healthy skepticism is an asset with AI tools:
- Question outputs, especially facts and numbers
- Test claims before relying on them
- Compare AI suggestions to your own knowledge
- Start small and build trust gradually

The workshop will help you develop practical judgment about when to trust AI output and when to verify it.

## Part 7: Preparing for the Workshop

### Before You Arrive

**Set up accounts (10 minutes):**

You'll need active accounts on at least two of these (free tiers are fine):

1. **ChatGPT** — [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com)
   - Create account with email
   - Free tier is sufficient

2. **Claude** — [claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
   - Create account with email
   - Free tier is sufficient

3. **Google Gemini** — [gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com)
   - Uses your Google account
   - Free tier is sufficient

**Test your access (5 minutes):**
- Log in to each tool
- Type a simple prompt: "Explain what you do in one sentence"
- Make sure you get a response
- If you're on a corporate network, check that the sites aren't blocked

**Think about your work (5 minutes):**
- What's one task you do every week that feels repetitive?
- What's one type of document you create regularly?
- What's one area where you wish you had a smart assistant?

You'll use these in the workshop exercises.

### What to Bring

- **Laptop** (not tablet — you'll need multiple browser tabs open)
- **Charger** (full day of screen work)
- **A real task** from your work (optional but valuable for Exercise 4)
- **Curiosity** and willingness to experiment

### What to Expect

The workshop is hands-on. You'll spend most of the day working with AI tools, not listening to lectures. Expect to:

- Try things that don't work on the first attempt
- See others get different results from the same tools
- Be surprised by what AI can do well
- Be equally surprised by what it gets wrong
- Leave with techniques you can use immediately

**There's no such thing as a stupid question in this workshop.** Everyone is at a different starting point, and the pace is designed to challenge both beginners and experienced users.

## Key Takeaways

1. **AI tools predict the next word** — they're pattern-matching engines, not thinking machines. Understanding this changes how you use them.

2. **Strong at drafting, weak at facts** — use AI for structure, writing, brainstorming, and formatting. Verify facts, numbers, and references yourself.

3. **Hallucination is the key risk** — AI delivers wrong answers with total confidence. Always review output critically.

4. **Context is everything** — the more specific information you provide, the better the output. Vague prompts produce vague results.

5. **Your data isn't necessarily private** — check your company's AI policy and never enter sensitive information into free-tier tools.

6. **AI is a tool, not a replacement** — the best results come from human expertise combined with AI speed. Know which parts to delegate.

7. **Healthy skepticism is an asset** — question, verify, and test. The professionals who get the most from AI are the ones who know its limits.

8. **Everyone is still figuring this out** — you're not behind. The technology is new and evolving. The workshop will give you practical skills to start using it effectively.
